The last big tour I went on I was presenting \"out\" as gender-queer the whole time and that was extremely difficult.",

I have to say that in the past few years a lot of ground has been broken, a lot of important conversations are happening and lots of really amazing bands are emerging. It's getting better, but it's still important to not get stuck on the \"Melbourne's so open and Melbourne's so free\" idea because it becomes fetishised as this cool attribute when really it's much more complicated.",

                "The term \u201cqueer ecology\u201d refers to a loose, interdisciplinary constellation of practices that aim, in different ways, to disrupt prevailing heterosexist discursive and institutional articulations of sexuality and nature, and also to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics in light of queer theory. Drawing from traditions as diverse as evolutionary biology, LGBTTIQQ2SA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, questioning, two-spirited, and allies) movements, and queer geography and history, feminist science studies, ecofeminism, and environmental justice, queer ecology currently highlights the complexity of contemporary biopolitics, draws important connections between the material and cultural dimensions of environmental issues, and insists on an articulatory practice in which sex and nature are understood in light of multiple trajectories of power and matter.",
                "In The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault lays the groundwork for much contemporary queer ecological scholarship in his observation that, beginning in the nineteenth century, modern regimes of biopower came to conceive of sex as a specific object of scientific knowledge, organized through, on the one hand, a \u201cbiology of reproduction\u201d that considered human sexual behavior in relation to the physiologies of plant and animal reproduction, and on the other, a \u201cmedicine of sex\u201d that conceived of human sexuality in terms of desire and identity (1978, 54). Although Foucault rightly notes the tenuous early connections between the two discourses, the establishment of sex as a matter of biopolitical truth could not help but be connected to ideas of nature, and especially to racialized, sexualized, and other anxieties over hygiene and degeneracy. In this context, the figure of the homosexual came to haunt the margins of emerging discourses in urban development, environmental health, and even wilderness preservation: the effeminate homosexual and the lesbian gender invert were not only seen increasingly as against nature but also sometimes considered symptoms of the toxic underside of industrial, urban, and increasingly cosmopolitan modernity.",
                "In this context, a prehistory of queer ecology must include the attempts of such authors as Andr\u00e9 Gide and Radclyffe Hall to turn these discourses on their heads (famously, of course, Oscar Wilde embraced his position \u201cagainst\u201d nature). Specifically, the placement of sexual desire and orientation in the purview of evolutionary concern gave rise not only to the articulation of homosexuality with degeneracy but also to the possibility that a variety of sexual practices and identities could be understood as \u201cnatural\u201d and, therefore, morally neutral; indeed, early sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote, in 1905, that \u201cone might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population\u201d (9). Drawing on the rich historical inclusion of same-sex (male) eroticism in pastoral literatures, Gide\u2019s Corydon (published in four parts from 1911 to 1920) thus pursued the idea that the homosexual activities of boy-shepherds represented a more authentic and innocent sexuality than the heterosexual conventions they needed to learn in order to enter into adult relations of (enforced) heterosexuality (Shuttleton 2000). Similarly, Hall\u2019s Well of Loneliness (1928) painted a tragic portrait of a lesbian gender invert who was, if anything, by nature nobler and more moral than any of the other characters in the book (a portrayal that caused the book to be banned in Britain, see Mortimer-Sandilands 2008b). Although both texts were thoroughly steeped in the class, racialized, and gender politics of the era and are problematic for a host of reasons associated with neopastoral literatures more broadly (Corydon is deeply misogynist; The Well is profoundly nationalist; both deploy nature as an agent of conservatism), they and others played an important role in setting the conceptual stage for more recent attempts to queer nature and ecology. Indeed, despite their considerable political differences, one can place in productive conversation with Gide and Hall such phenomena as the post-Stonewall emergence of gay and lesbian-feminist anti-urbanisms (Herring 2007; Kleiner 2003; Sandilands 2002) and the more recent articulation of (some) discourses on urban cruising and public sex with organicist renderings of eroticism, freedom, and opposition to heteronormative productions of/restrictions on urban public space (Gandy 2012; Ingram 2010).",
                "From these roots, beginning in the mid-1990s (e.g., Undercurrents 1994; Gaard 1997), a distinct body of queer ecological scholarship has emerged that has attempted to develop theoretical and activist connections between sexual and ecological politics, often drawing from ecofeminist and environmental justice perspectives and including concerted attention to the racialized, gendered, colonial, and species politics with which notions of sex and nature are articulated (especially as influenced by the writings of Donna Haraway, e.g., 1991b). As Rachel Stein writes, \u201cby analyzing how discourses of nature have been used to enforce heteronormativity, to police sexuality, and to punish and exclude those persons who have been deemed sexually transgressive, we can begin to understand the deep, underlying commonalities between struggles against sexual oppression and other struggles for environmental justice\u201d (2004, 7). This emphasis on the intersectional politics of sexuality, race, and ecology informs the work of Dayna Scott (2009) and Giovanna Di Chiro (2010), both of whom develop critical responses to the \u201cgender-bending\u201d impacts of endocrine-disrupting hormones in the environment (which particularly affect racialized and indigenous communities) while simultaneously disrupting heterosexist panics about the so-called feminization of organisms and populations of organisms, human and otherwise. Beth Berila (2004), Stacy Alaimo (2010a), and Mel Chen (2012) likewise examine the politics of contamination as toxic affects move in, through, and as gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies: as Chen writes powerfully, toxic substances and discourses organize worlds in which some biopolitical subjects are enabled and their life optimized by medical and environmental interventions at the same time as other subjects are themselves considered toxic, expellable, and expendable. And Eli Clare (1999) treats the intersections of class and disability in his account of (among other things) the varied exclusions of an urban environmental politics and aesthetics that pays scant critical attention to the ways in which people work and move in natural environments, and also to bodies and landscapes that are abjected in the production and management of the pristine.",
                "Sharing similar roots but on a slightly different trajectory, beginning in the late 1990s (although drawing on a longer line of inquiry, see Terry 2000), research in animal behavior by the likes of Bruce Bagemihl (1999) and Joan Roughgarden (2004) has drawn popular attention to the fact that a large array of animal species include elements of same-sex eroticism in their sexual repertoires; in so doing, this research has attempted to dislodge heterosexual reproduction from its singularly privileged place in evolutionary biology, to connect notions of sexual diversity with biological diversity (for a critique, see McWhorter 2010), and to open the door for a nonteleological reconsideration of animal/human sociality and pleasure (Alaimo 2010b; Johnson 2011). As homonormative popular culture has embraced so-called queer animals in the midst of a larger naturalization of same-sex marriage (especially \u201cgay\u201d male penguins, see Sturgeon 2010), and as images of polymorphously perverse animal and invertebrate sex have come to populate the ideosphere in the service of sexual pluralism (Green Porno 2009), several scholars suggest ways in which this queering of the more-than-human could proceed in more critical directions. Elizabeth Wilson (2002) and Myra Hird (2004, 2008) consider the ways in which nonhuman sexual and gender diversity both calls into question human exceptionalism and destabilizes notions of identity, authenticity, and technology on which modern categories of human sexual orientation rest; Karen Barad (2012), deploying a notion of queer performativity to strong posthumanist ends, explores the ways in which the material world can be understood as unfolding according to a process of relational co-constitution in which materialization itself can be understood queerly (see also Morton 2010); and several authors call upon the queer potentialities of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s thought in order to nudge queer and trans theory to think more ecologically, in other words, to consider sexual and gender becomings as complex biological, technological, and political assemblages rather than as either purely discursive or biologically determined processes (Parisi 2008; MacCormack 2009; Chisholm 2010; Hayward 2008\u00a0and, for a critique,\u00a0Garrard 2010).",
                "Recent scholarship has drawn from combinations of these theoretical trajectories (and beyond) to generate a proliferating array of queer ecological possibilities, including provocative considerations of cross-species and eco-sexualities as part of an ethico-political opening of love to include more-than-human corporealities (e.g.,\u00a0Kuzniar 2008; Sandilands 2004; Stephens and Sprinkle 2012); of the implications of queer theorist Lee Edelman\u2019s critique of reproductive futurism for ecological politics (Giffney 2008; Anderson 2011; Seymour 2013); and of canonical literary texts, reread and restaged in light of queer ecological concerns (Estok 2011; Azzarello 2012). In addition, new forms of specifically ecoqueer activism, demonstrating interesting forms of coalitional politics in opposition to homonormative agendas, are also emerging in response to such concerns as violence, space, and food (Hogan 2010; Sbicca 2012). In both theoretical and activist milieux, however, questions remain about the specific meaning of the term \u201cqueer,\u201d given its historically and politically unstable relations to LGBTTIQQ2SA communities and activisms; the current constellation of queer ecologies\u2014including as it does both more conventional lgbt histories and communities and more recent challenges to these terms and political affinities\u2014may be on the verge of something new."

There\u2019s something that is going on in the community and I think fatherlessness has contributed to it greatly because if you haven\u2019t been loved by your father, just like young ladies do, young men can do the same thing.

                "Remember that time, roughly two months ago, when President Trump promised not to roll back an order protecting the rights of LGBTQ workers? Yeah, well, he lied. Surprise!",
                "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order revoking key parts of previous orders by President Obama, which had effectively banned federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Under Executive Order 13673, which Obama issued in 2014, companies receiving federal contracts in excess of half a million dollars were required to demonstrate they had complied with a set of 15 federal or state labor laws over the previous three years; several of those laws offered critical protections for LGBTQ workers.",
                "The measure, also known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order, was issued in conjunction with Executive Order 13672, the latter of which explicitly prohibited federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexuality. Although Trump did not erase that order, his mandate to eliminate order 13673 cripples its effectiveness. By removing the requirement that companies prove their compliance with federal law, the government has no way to ensure they\u2019re also following the nondiscrimination requirements Obama explicitly laid out. In other words, the president has created a major loophole that could allow companies to deny LGBTQ people opportunities or otherwise treat them unequally\u2014and those organizations can still receive massive federal contracts.",
                "\u201cThis administration has made it extremely difficult to enforce these federal laws as applied to federal contractors,\u201d Camilla Taylor, senior counsel at the LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal, told Keen News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s sending a message to these companies . . . that the federal government simply doesn\u2019t care whether or not they violate the law.\u201d",
                "Due to a lack of explicit protections for sexual orientation and gender identity in most states and on the federal level, Obama\u2019s presidential orders were the only legal measures protecting more than 1 million LGBTQ workers. As Think Progress reports, the orders merely amended previous executive actions that protected federal contractor employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, nationality, disability, and age\u2014all identity categories that are still guaranteed protection under other federal laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, and Age Discrimination in Employment Act. No such act directly affords workers protection on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity; that\u2019s what necessitated order 13672 in the first place.",
                "Erasure seems to be something Trump has a knack for when it comes to the LGBTQ community: This week, the Census Bureau announced it would not include data on sexual orientation or gender identity in its 2020 survey, a decision the White House can directly influence. By refusing to count LGBTQ people in the United States, the Trump administration is also refusing to take the necessary steps to represent them and their interests. Then again, by refusing to keep in place rules that afford LGBTQ people protection from discrimination, Trump isn\u2019t just refusing to acknowledge that discrimination exists; he\u2019s suggesting it might even be business as usual."

Psychology has traditionally regarded as inevitable -- and, in fact, necessary -- a female child's eventual separation from her mother as adulthood ensues. Now renowned psychologist and author Martha Manning offers mothers and daughters of all ages a revolutionary new way of understanding each other and their relationships, and challenges the accepted thinking that this powerful bond must ultimately be severed. In a work of intelligence, wit, heart, and scholarship, Manning examines this important link and concludes that it is a precious attachment that is never outgrown -- that, while the differing, ever-changing needs, conflicts, and obligations of two distinct women may create a chasm between them, bridging the gap will serve to strengthen a lifelong commitment, love, and identity, while fostering essential independence. The key is empathy.",

Exploring the developmental stages of the mother-daughter union from infancy through old age, Manning provides potent tools to help us build stronger ties, enabling us to celebrate rather than eschew the twists and turns, joys, secrets, and surprises inherent in this most glorious of life connections. She also focuses new attention on the parts played by cultural, historical, psychological, and biological influences, areas often ignored in previous works on the subject.",

For everyone who is, and always will be, a mother, a daughter, or both, this important, inspiring book will guide the reader toward a new love and respect born of understanding and the enriching ability to find the common thread."

Thus, her young adulthood chapter wonderfully dissects the elements of change, autonomy, and the new roles mothers assume as their daughters enter this stage; yet along the route, readers will find gems in Manning's references to Venn diagrams, passports, many contemporary books and plays, and a sitcom-worthy transcript from a visit to her elderly parents, titled, \"You Can Never Have Too Much Heat and Light.\" ",

I think he already had\u00a0Ryan in mind, and Ryan is someone I love as well. I didn\u2019t know exactly what he wanted to make, but there was an organic creative process between the three of us, so we came in with an idea of the character, the world and the story, but then things really developed through conversations. It was a unique project in the sense that we\u2019re all queer artists that knew and respected and trusted each other, so it was quite a fluid process.

It\u2019s a beautiful story which I wanted to narrate through an emotional quality, so having movement that\u00a0was slightly pulled back allowed these characters to be more vulnerable, then a little shameful, and then powerful. For me, it\u2019s about the transformation of the queer boy and how he gained power throughout his narrative, it wasn\u2019t through sexual relations. It was more about personal empowerment and gathering strength from inside. Hopefully people will be drawn to these emotions, not drawn to it because it\u2019s super sexy or super physical.

What\u2019s brilliant is that, in a short period of time, we\u2019ve built in Olly\u2019s acting and Ryan\u2019s choreography to create a story with emotional layers, conflicts and contradictions. It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t often see that with LGBTQ characters. It was also a\u00a0such a nice process because the whole cast was LGBTQ and everyone around us, whether queer or not, was insanely supportive. It became a wonderful family experience \u2013 nobody was ever worried about judgement, and that definitely adds a new element to the film itself.",

I wrote most of the album about that relationship and it has its own story, so there was an element of me knowing what I wanted with the video. But, when\u00a0Matt and Ryan came on board, I realised I had to let that go and trust what would come from them creatively and organically.\u00a0The process was much better because I have this personal\u00a0attachment, but I was really happy to let go of that and just feel the narratives and the story as they went in a different direction. I was excited for that spontaneity as opposed to feeling too committed to a specific meaning or translation of the song.",

When heterosexual women make out with one another at a bar or party, it\u2019s generally understood that they\u2019re simply playing around for attention, or exploring the fluid space that is female sexuality. When heterosexual men hook up with each other, on the other hand, it\u2019s seen either as an act born of desperation \u2014 think men who are locked up \u2014 or an indication that while they may claim to be straight, they really aren\u2019t \u2014 think disgraced GOP members of Congress.

In Not Gay: Sex Between Straight White Men, out last month from NYU Press, Jane Ward, an associate professor of women\u2019s studies at the University of California, Riverside, makes the case that this is a flawed understanding. In doing so, she shows that homosexual contact has been a regular feature of heterosexual life ever since the concepts of homo- and heterosexuality were first created \u2014 not just in prisons and frat houses and the military, but in biker gangs and even conservative suburban neighborhoods. Given how prevalent this behavior is in so many different sorts of settings, Ward suggest it\u2019s time to stop explaining it away \u2014 and argues that society\u2019s conception of male heterosexuality is an unrealistic, expedient\u00a0one.",

Right, and it\u2019s not just sort of conventional wisdom or conservative ideology that teaches that. I think there\u2019s been a lot of sexological and psychological research suggesting that men\u2019s sexuality is more rigid than women\u2019s and that women are inherently more sexually fluid. And what I argue in the book is that even that research is situated within some long-held beliefs about the fundamental difference between men and women that are not accurate from a feminist perspective. It\u2019s interesting, because if you look at this belief that women\u2019s sexuality is more receptive\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it\u2019s more fluid, it\u2019s triggered by external stimuli, that women have the capacity to be sort of aroused by anything and everything \u2014 it really just reinforces what we want to believe about women, which is that women are always sexually available\u00a0people.",

I talk about that as the logic of homosexual necessity in the book and that comes up a lot, this claim that, well, men have to do this for X or Y reason. There\u2019s simply no other choice.

I mean, certainly I understand that peer pressure is real and that it needs to be taken seriously, but I just don\u2019t think in every case the participants engaging in an elephant walk, that they\u2019re truly afraid for their life or fearful of violence or whatever \u2014 and these are the same boys who two years later do this to\u00a0others.",

                "If you haven't heard the allegations that Minnesota State Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, a faithful proponent of the GOP's crusade to define marriage as a state of tenuous forbearance between a man and a woman, had an \"improper relationship\" with a male Senate staffer, chances are you've been paying pretty close attention.",
                "Considering the fit of Puritanical apoplexy that wracked the national media when Anthony Weiner accidentally showed everyone that he shaves his balls or the fact that even the mayor of a suburban hamlet like Medford, NJ can poke his head out of the molehill of local news and get caught in the national spotlight for soliciting gay sex, it would seem that Amy Koch's December 16 resignation from the Minnesota State Senate in the wake of rumored infidelity would put the perfect cervical cap on a year marked by lurid political sex scandals. Or so says Hypervocal writer Slade Sohmer, who wonders why Koch's alleged infidelity hasn't been embellished by any sexy details and why her subsequent resignation hasn't received more attention from the national media. The Koch saga seems tailor-made to whet the media's appetite for sanctimonious banter but, as Sohmer points out, the news wires aren't exactly crackling in the wake of the resignation. He writes,",
                "Sohmer dismisses that theory that any story could be \"too local\" in an age of 24-hour news coverage, though he doesn't offer another explanation and instead explores the gender gap in political sex scandals. The reason behind Koch's abrupt resignation should make for a bigger story for how very anomalous (but not unheard of) it seems in a landscape of sexual impropriety that's dominated by male politicians who, by tweeting dick pics, are performing the 21st human equivalent of a chimpanzee waving its genitals. Like her sexting GOP predecessor Vikings stadium, is that it's missing one crucial element for lively political drama: reality-bending denial.",
                "According to the Associated Press report, when a cabal of Minnesota senators confronted Koch about the allegations of improper conduct, they gave her three options: resign from office, deny the allegations, or fess up to the rest of the senate. Koch resigned and has subsequently slipped out of the spotlight, refusing to address the circumstances surrounding her resignation. Could the difference in a media bonanza and sober local coverage be as simple as the fact that, once confronted, Koch chose to keep quiet instead of fabricating a complex Twitter hacking conspiracy? Or is the relative silence surrounding Koch's resignation more proof that national media outlets see the combination of political power and sexual autonomy in a woman might shatter our cultural innocence?",
                "According to a May article in The Atlantic by Lane Wallace, sex scandals involving female politicians are rare precisely because a powerful man is perceived as an attractive Casanova while a powerful woman is perceived as a testicle-devouring she-wolf. Wallace claims that this cultural disparity gives way to another, that \"Culturally, men are more likely to link power with a sense of entitlement about rewards that include sex.\" Maybe the real reason Koch's alleged adultery hasn't crested the national news is because we're so accustomed to a man exploiting his political authority for sex (a much more familiar narrative) that it seems like an exclusively male transgression and that any story of a woman exploiting her authority seems too outlandish to be believed. In the same way everyone wondered this summer whether or not Bridesmaids would do well at the box office (will audiences accept that can ladies really be funny? That they can have commitment issues?), news outlets might be wondering whether something so outrageous as a woman in politics having an affair won't mind-fuck American news audiences."

This means that while gay, lesbian, and bisexual people will receive protection from being fired, denied service, or facing eviction because of who they are, transgender people are basically on their own in that department, and it's not the first time we're seeing that distinction being made.\u00a0",
                "Not only are transgender people still not as protected across the board as LGB people, more and more laws are coming out to ensure they're not only unprotected, but punished for being who they are. There have been a slew of recent proposed policies about transgender bathroom usage barring transgender individuals from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity, or else they'll face a fine\u00a0in some cases.\u00a0",
                "There have also been several private Christian colleges that were granted an exception to an anti-discrimination law by the U.S. Department of Education, so they could be free to discriminate against transgender people, even though all the schools get federal funding and Title IX states\u00a0they can't do that.",
                "Kris Hayashi, executive director at the Transgender Law Center, told Cosmopolitan.com that the history of laws and advocacy efforts that help the lesbian and gay community\u00a0but fail to protect the transgender community\u00a0are rich indeed. Hiyashi does note that while we're seeing a cultural shift in transgender visibility in the media, they're still being singled out for harassment and discrimination, perhaps because of the recent increase in visibility.",
                "\"Lately, we're seeing legislative attacks that target gender nonconforming people and trans youth, such as what happened in Indiana and their excluding trans people,\" Hayashi said. \"There should not be legislation moving forward that protects lesbian and gay communities, but explicitly excludes transgender communities. As we've seen the recent shift to more comprehensive legislation for LGBT people and an increase in transgender visibility, we've also been seeing a small group of right-wing extremists who want to turn the tide back against that acceptance we've been seeing.\" So the more socially conservative people are seeing trans people in the media, the more they are trying to exclude them.",
                "And being trans, it turns out, is basically a discrimination trump card. Many transgender individuals also\u00a0identify as lesbian or gay, but in the eyes of these lawmakers, they are transgender above all else. So you could be a transgender woman who identifies as a lesbian, but according to these laws, your being transgender would trump your protections against discrimination as a lesbian. The distinction between gender and sexuality is rarely made in the eyes of people who don't really understand either one, but the gay community has made so much progress over the last 20\u00a0years that the ground the LGB has to stand on is a lot firmer than it once was. The transgender community, however, has only recently been allowed to begin to lay down the foundation.\u00a0",
                "Fortunately, places like New York City have been working hard\u00a0on legislation\u00a0to protect transgender individuals, a trend we can only hope will spread to the more conservative states as soon as possible.\u00a0These steps, while not ultimately solving everything for every transgender person in the country, are vital to creating a path that will be impossible for the groups Hiyashi references to flat-out deny rights to transgender people that LGB individuals are given.",
                "The hope among\u00a0trans law advocates is that\u00a0the increased\u00a0discrimination\u00a0the transgender community is now\u00a0facing is\u00a0a backlash to increased trans visibility,\u00a0a passing storm of anger. Perhaps when seeing a trans person on TV becomes commonplace, the skies will clear and the T can catch up to its LGB.\u00a0",

Laws Bottled in Bond Secale Straight Rye Whiskey, which earlier this year was awarded World\u2019s Best Rye for 2017 at the World Whiskies Awards by\u00a0Whiskey Magazine. This expression meets the high standards for the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and is coaxed from a mash bill of 95% rye and 5% barley malt. Distilled, aged and bottled by LWH in Denver, this whiskey was aged over 4 years in new, full-sized, 53-gallon, char #3, American white oak barrels.",
                "Laws Whiskey House focuses exclusively on traditional American-style whiskeys made from the four American mother grains; corn, wheat, rye and barley. Bottled in Bond (Bonded) whiskey is a cornerstone in the LWH lineup. Bonded whiskeys are bottled under U.S. government supervision and must be the production of a single season, single distillery, single DSP, aged in a federally-bonded warehouse for at least four years, and bottled at 100 proof. Last year, Laws Whiskey House was the first distillery in Colorado history to produce a Bottled in Bond whiskey and released the first Bottled in Bond expression in the rapidly-growing Four Grain Straight Bourbon category. The distillery currently offers four Bottled in Bond expressions complimented by several other non-bonded straight whiskeys.",
                "Following 200 cases of Batch A17, availability of B17 is expected to be 300 9-liter cases, with distribution in CO, NY, NJ, DC, IL, MN, WI, WA, TX, AK and TN. MSRP of the 750 mL will be $75. The next release of Bottled in Bond Secale Straight Rye Whiskey is not expected until November 2017."

                "The University of Toronto Homophile Association, the province\u2019s first group to rally around lesbian and gay rights, was honoured yesterday at a ceremony that marked their historic formation in 1969.",
                "Officials from U of T, the Ontario Heritage Trust (OHT) and three levels of government commemorated the historic group\u2019s formation by unveiling a provincial plaque at University College \u2013 the site of the U of T Homophile Association\u2019s first meeting 42 years ago.",
                "\u201cThe U of T has been a proud supporter of the proposal to install this plaque at the heart of our founding campus,\u201d said President David Naylor. \u201cWe are also proud of the decades-long history of campus LGBT advocacy that has made the university a better place.\u201d",
                "The plaque \u2013 sponsored by U of T\u2019s Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies and the Ontario Heritage Trust \u2013 is Ontario\u2019s first LGBT-related provincial plaque. It was unveiled at a ceremony at East Hall in University College and will later be placed on the east side of the college.",
                "The U of T Homophile Association, which was Canada\u2019s first university-based lesbian/gay organization, set the stage for similar groups to form at other Ontario universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The pioneering group sponsored lectures from prominent international activists, challenged discrimination against gays and lesbians in Canada\u2019s public service, protested police surveillance in Toronto and highlighted prejudice in the media.",
                "Early members helped to shape activism across Ontario and in Canada. Jearld Moldenhauer established Glad Day Bookshop, the country\u2019s first to specialize in lesbian and gay literature, and helped form The Body Politic, a magazine with international significance. The group\u2019s first chair \u2013 Charlie Hill \u2013became a well-known community organizer and activist in Toronto and Ottawa, and Ian Young, another key organizer, published a groundbreaking book of gay poetry, Year of the Quiet Sun.",
                "The group disbanded in 1973, but they acted as a prototype for lesbian, gay and transgender activism across the country and lent momentum to the equality movement.",
                "As Bonham Centre director Brenda Cossman pointed out, \u201cHonouring queer history is essential:\u00a0 it reminds all of us that university campuses play crucial roles in nurturing change, and that our ability to do the kind of work we do in the present comes from generations of courageous advocacy in the past.\u201d",
                "The idea to mark the establishment of the U of T Homophile Association came from a working group at the university\u2019s Bonham Centre, who then submitted the proposal to the OHT."

                "Seeing their child get married is bittersweet for many parents. \u00a0After all, you were their whole world for a long time, and they were yours. Now you\u2019re changing allegiances as it were. It\u2019s no wonder that parental relationships can quickly become a source of stress in a marriage. ",
                "It doesn\u2019t have to be that way though. Navigating your new relationship with your parents with positivity and respect is possible.",
                "Here are some of the key ways your relationship with your parents will change after marriage and what you can do to keep the relationship healthy. ",
                "For many years, your parents were one of your main emotional supports. From kissing skinned knees as a kid and being there through school dramas, to supporting you as you went on to college or a job, your parents have always been there for you. ",
                "After you get married, your spouse becomes one of your key sources of support, and the change can be challenging for you and your parents. ",
                "For the sake of your marriage, get into the habit of turning to your partner first, and encouraging them to do the same. Your parents don\u2019t have to feel pushed out, though \u2013 make regular time to get together for a coffee or a meal and catch them up on what\u2019s going on in your life. ",
                "Marriage represents leaving the nest and becoming more self reliant. Of course this isn\u2019t the 17th century and the chances are you\u2019re not literally leaving your parental home for the first time, nor are ladies expected to be obedient while men earn all the money! ",
                "However, even if you\u2019ve been financially independent and living away from home for years, marriage still represents a psychological shift. Your parents can still love and support you, but it\u2019s time to stop relying on them. ",
                "Honor this change by acknowledging that your parents don\u2019t owe you anything, nor do you owe them, so you can meet each other as equals.",

                "This can be a difficult adjustment for parents. If you find your then popping in unannounced, coming for an afternoon but overstaying their welcome, or assuming you will put them up for a week\u2019s vacation, some things need to change. ",
                "Setting clear boundaries around your time and space will help you manage expectations and keep a healthy relationship with your parents. Be upfront about when and how often you can see them, and stick to that. ",
                "Your parents are used to you being their top priority \u2013 and they\u2019re used to being one of yours. Realizing that your spouse is now your main priority can be difficult for even the most loving parents. \u00a0",
                "This can lead to resentment, interference, or bad feeling between your parents and your spouse. \u00a0",
                "Clear communication can go a long way here. Sit down and have a good heart to heart with your parents. Let them know that you need to put your spouse first, but that you still love them dearly and want them in your life. \u00a0",
                "Many issues boil down to insecurity on your parents\u2019 part as they adjust to your new dynamic, so do your best to work on that insecurity together. Be firm but loving as you set boundaries, and offer plenty of reassurance that they\u2019re not losing you. ",
                "The chances are your parents are used to being involved in your financial decisions to at least some degree. Maybe they\u2019ve lent you money before, or perhaps they\u2019ve offered advice on jobs or finances, or even offered you a place to rent or a share in the family business. ",
                "After you\u2019re married, this involvement can quickly cause tension. Finances are a matter for you and your spouse to tackle together without any outside interference. ",
                "This means cutting the apron springs on both sides. You need to set good boundaries with your parents around financial issues. No ifs or buts \u2013 financial issues are a no go zone. By the same token, you need turn to your spouse with financial issues, not your parents. It\u2019s best not to accept loans or favors unless you really must, as even the most well-intentioned gestures can quickly become points of contention. ",
                "A changing relationship with your parents is inevitable when you get married, but that doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. With good boundaries and a loving attitude you can build a strong relationship with your parents that\u2019s healthy for you, them, and your new spouse. "

Both Nick Clegg and David Cameron have explicitly said that this ban must be relinquished to help address the low stocks in the blood bank.",
                "Lewis's comments are outdated, arguably by over 10 years. Once society grants a community a clear link to a deadly infection, as was the case with gays and HIV, that community increases its cautiousness.

Although many point out that a good chunk of these infections are believed to have been contracted abroad, statistically meaning that in the UK you are still less likely to be infected if you engage in heterosexual activities, the numbers are still very chilling. It proves convincingly that many heterosexuals do not consider HIV to be an infection likely to affect them. The myth of the gay disease may have heightened awareness of HIV among gays, but it has also sent a wave of complacency across the heterosexual community.",

Recent research commissioned by the New York City department of health showed worryingly that only 23% of women will insist on male partners using a condom during anal sex, compared with 61% of gay or bisexual men. These are not just slight differences. The ignorance over the dangers of HIV and the assumption that it is confined to homosexuals points towards a continuing sharp increase in heterosexual contractions of the infection \u2013 not through carelessness, but through ignorance. All public figures, including Lewis, should show an element of responsibility in killing the fiction surrounding HIV.",

Since 1997, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party have pursued the gay rights agenda vociferously, making every effort to carry public opinion wherever opposition was to be found. Cameron has already committed to revoking the gay blood ban, so surely he must therefore accept that the intrinsic link between HIV and the gay community is little more than an archaic misconception.

We will also be asking our friends and colleagues to donate what they can so that we can present our partners at Para La Naturaleza with funds to support their efforts throughout the country to educate people about the very issues that are impacting the island today, to protect the biodiversity of Puerto Rico, and to help with repairs and other support they need.

We are working with partners to see if we can share some highlights of the conference virtually and sponsor several webinars and other online events with some of our conference speakers and presenters during the week the conference would have been held. We are putting a schedule together and will be reaching out to a number of you to see if you can help. We know it won\u2019t be the same, but it will allow us to share a few highlights, thank our incredible sponsors, and give everyone a chance to interact and contribute online.

                " Taiwanese often joke ruefully about how westerners confuse Thailand with their democratic, self-ruled island off the coast of China. But the uninitiated got an unexpected primer last week in Taiwan\u2019s struggle toward democracy when President-elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory call from the island\u2019s first female president, Tsai Ing-wen. ",
                " Now, with Taiwan\u2019s name fresh in the public\u2019s vernacular, Taiwanese-American LGBTQ activists also want the world to know that their island could become the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. ",
                " \u201cThis is a good way for us show that as a country, we might not be doing as well economically compared to China or South Korea or Japan,\u201d Wen Liu, a 29-year-old doctoral student who identifies as queer, told NBC News. \u201cBut then I think Taiwan, as a small country, is really trying to put forth another vision for Asian democracy, for a place that can hold liberal values and gender and sexual equality.\u201d ",
                " Bringing their fight for marriage equality to the West, Taiwanese LGBTQ activists abroad have held rallies in U.S. cities, including Seattle and Chicago, as well as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, according to Liu. ",
                " Just this past Saturday, a group of 70 to 80 demonstrators marched from Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park to the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, said Liu, an organizer with Overseas Taiwanese for Democracy. The bar was the site of an uprising in 1969 that launched the fight for gay and lesbian rights in the United States. ",
                " While just one in five in China favor accepting homosexuality, according to a 2013 study from Pew Research Center, roughly one in two in Taiwan support legalizing same-sex marriage, a Nationalist party poll published late November in the island\u2019s United Daily News reported. ",
                " Practical concerns, such as sharing assets and having a family, are important to LGBTQ Taiwanese hoping to marry, Liu said. Marriage equality, she added, is \u201ca stepping stone to gain more visibility and symbolic recognition.\u201d ",
                " But challenges remain on the island of 23 million, where nearly one in two also said they couldn\u2019t accept a family member who is LGBTQ, according to the same Nationalist party poll. ",
                " \u201cEspecially [for] younger folks, even when the marriage is legalized, it\u2019s still hard to come out to their parents,\u201d Liu said. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a huge cultural issue that will probably take a longer time.\u201d ",
                " RELATED: Taiwan Set to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage, a First in Asia ",
                " That a lot of younger Taiwanese still live at home also complicates things, Liu added. Because of the economy, she said, some cannot afford to move out on their own. ",
                " \u201cIf you can\u2019t live alone, you have to stay with your parents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to even think about having a family.\u201d ",
                " Much of the debate in Taiwan now has centered on whether to amend the civil code to include same-sex couples under the definition of marriage, or to pass special legislation granting partnership or marriage rights. ",
                " Regular protests on both sides have become commonplace throughout the island. Last week, thousands of LGBTQ supporters packed the streets of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, in support of revising the code. Others against same-sex marriage, including religious groups, did the same over the past weekend. ",
                " In Taiwan\u2019s LGBTQ community, many oppose a special partnership law since it would apply only to gays rather than open up marriage for all, Liu said. ",
                " \u201cHaving more liberal LGBTQ rights will be a good way not only to benefit the LGBTQ population in Taiwan, but also to just let the world know that Taiwan is a country for social democracy and [has] a lot of the liberal values that progressives in the U.S. also hold,\u201d she said.

",
                " The Hawaii judge said the State Department's list, announced June 29, was too restrictive in declaring that only parents, parents-in-law, spouses, fianc\u00e9s, children, and children-in-law would be exempt from the ban on visas for travel to the U.S. The Supreme Court ruled June 26 that while portions of the travel ban could be enforced, people overseas \"who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\" with a relative or organization in the U.S. would be exempt. ",
                " But Wednesday's Supreme Court order blocked enforcement of another part of the Hawaii judge's ruling, applying to refugees. The state of Hawaii had argued that any refugee who had an arrangement with a U.S.-based aid group to come to the U.S. should also be exempt from the travel ban. The justices said the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in California, should decide that question. ",

If they\u2019ve never met before, it\u2019s high time for that first introduction, and even if they have had a chance or two to chat, there\u2019s no time like the present to help them get to know one another a little bit better. We asked our experts for their top tips to help this important relationship get off on the right foot.",
                "Traditionally, the parents of the groom are supposed to reach out to the parents of the bride to arrange that first meeting. While we\u2019re all for tradition, if your mom just can\u2019t wait to meet your future mother-in-law (and your FMIL doesn\u2019t live her life according to Emily Post), your parents can definitely make the first move. Or, if you don\u2019t want to risk a faux pas, the two of you can arrange a meeting, instead. This option is becoming more and more popular, especially for couples who have dated for a while.",

But if you\u2019re from the East Coast, your partner is from the Midwest, and you both live in California, arranging to get your parents in one place could be tough. And while it might be the easiest choice, having your parents and your future in-laws come to visit for multiple days at the same time is a lot of pressure with no easy escape plan. In this instance, meeting in the days leading up to the wedding is probably your best bet. Ask both sets of parents to come to town a few days before you tie the knot so you can have a leisurely afternoon or evening getting to know one another before the stress kicks in.",

It\u2019s a gracious gesture for one set of parents to offer to host, but finding somewhere neutral (whether your own home or a local restaurant) will make everyone much more comfortable. This way your dad isn\u2019t worried about manning the stove when he should be talking to your in-laws, and your S.O.\u2019s parents aren\u2019t nervous about making themselves comfortable in someone else\u2019s home. Choose a setting that\u2019s affordable (like a mid-priced restaurant) and crowd-pleasing (think Italian, not sushi). Make sure the setting is on the quiet side so you can all carry on a conversation!",

If you know who will be paying ahead of time, you\u2019ll be able to cater the setting to the host\u2019s budget. Etiquette states that the groom\u2019s parents pay during this first meeting, but that\u2019s much more flexible than it used to be. Your parents may want to pay if your in-laws are visiting from out of town, or you and your S.O. may decide to pay yourselves and avoid any awkward moments.",

You know your own parents, and are probably familiar with your in-laws, so use what you know to lead the conversation to common interests. Think about the topics in advance to avoid a conversation that feels like an interrogation. Get the \u201cWhere do you live? What do you do?\u201d questions out of the way quickly or, better yet, use them as a jumping-off point. If your father is a chef and your mother-in-law is an avid home cook, steer the conversation toward their common interest.",

                "\n\tSometime after about two million years ago, somewhere in Africa, mothers in a certain group of apes\u2014our ancestors\u2014began rearing their young in a new way. Unlike chimpanzees and gorillas today, these ape mothers allowed others to help in the rearing of their infants. This seemingly modest behavioral change, argues anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy in Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding (Harvard, 2009), had a major impact on the evolution of modern humans. In this conversation with Graham Townsley, producer of \"Becoming Human\" and a trained anthropologist himself, Hrdy explains why she believes this change led to the evolution of some of the signature attributes of humans, including empathy, cooperation, even our large brains.",
                "\n\tSarah Hrdy: Well, no other mammal depended on so many others so much for so long as human youngsters growing up. It takes on the order of 13 million calories to rear human youngsters from birth to nutritional independence when they can produce what they need for themselves without a lot of subsidies. This is so much more than a mother by herself could provide, especially because she's likely to give birth again to an even more dependent child. So like human mothers today, Homo erectus mothers needed an awful lot of help.",
                "\n\tA lot of our hypothesizing about early hominins started with some version of the Man-the-Hunter/Sex Contract model. So when the Australopithecus afarensis \"Lucy\" was discovered [she lived about three million years ago], it was simply assumed that, oh yes, she needed help, so it must have been her mate who provided it. In a very influential article on the \"Origin of Man,\" the paleontologist Owen Lovejoy argued that men became bipedal so that they could carry prey back to a mother and her young waiting back at camp.",
                "\n\tWell, there are a lot of reasons why this just doesn't work well. First of all, mothers weren't waiting at camp. They were foraging and gathering just as chimps do and as all hunter-gatherer mothers do. But also we have to think more about fathers and what it means to be a hominin father. [Hominin refers to all species that are human or human ancestors, including early humans such as Homo erectus as well as earlier ancestors such as Australopithecus. See Who's Who in Human Evolution.]",
                "\n\tOur best proxy organism there is human fathers, especially those still living as hunter-gatherers. And while we know that human fathers can be terribly committed to their offspring and can be critical for their survival, we also know that some fathers die, defect, or simply prove inadequate in terms of how much food they are able to provide. After all, hunting is a dicey occupation. So to depend on a father alone to provide regular meals for offspring is just not practical.",
                "\n\tSo how could mothers be producing these incredibly needy offspring? I mean, Mother Nature\u2014my metaphor for Darwinian natural selection\u2014does not ordinarily set reproducers up to fail. This is not how natural selection operates. Mothers must have been producing these costly offspring with the expectation that should help from fathers not be enough, there might be recourse to help from others as well.",
                "\n\tYes. Just in the last 10 years, as we've started to actually look at what it takes in a hunter-gatherer context to keep children alive, what we're learning highlights the importance not just of parents but also of alloparents\u2014group members other than the genetic mother and father. Grandmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and older siblings.",
                "\n\tYes. We have to keep in mind that we're not talking about a modern context. When someone like me gives birth, I have good reason to expect that my children are going to survive. Ninety-eight percent or more of children born in a western industrialized nation survive to maturity. This was not true for our ancestors. Nor is it true for other primates under natural conditions. Average mortality rates of 40, 50, 60 percent of youngsters dying before they mature are common. The difficulty of keeping offspring alive cannot be overestimated. It was just really rough.",
                "\n\tOne reason, I think, that hominin populations remained so low for so long, so steady throughout so much of the Pleistocene [the epoch dated to roughly 1.8 million-12,000 years ago], was that these individuals had trouble replacing themselves. There's no indication until maybe around 20,000 years ago that these populations were starting to grow. Once they start to grow, though, then in record time we circled the globe and hit six billion. But before that it was really touch-and-go for a long time. So I think we need to pay much more attention to how these people managed to replace themselves.",
                "\n\tWell, about 40 to 50 percent of all primate species have some form of shared care. Only maybe 20 percent have both shared care and shared provisioning, and, besides us, the only one with a great deal of alloparental provisioning are in the subfamily Callitrichidae, composed of the marmosets and tamarins.",
                "\n\tBut we're the only great ape that has shared care of any kind. In chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas, the mother cares exclusively for her infant. For example, a mother orangutan will not allow any other individual to take her infant. She will be in constant skin-to-skin contact with that baby for at least the first six months of life, not a moment out of contact, and that baby's going to nurse for as long as seven years. This is a very single-minded, dedicated, exclusive kind of care. Unfortunately, poachers know this and are very aware that the only way to capture, say, an infant chimpanzee to sell in the market is to first kill the mother.",
                "\n\tHuman mothers are very different, in that in every traditional society for which we have information, mothers do allow others to hold and help them carry and care for their infants shortly after birth. This is a really major difference, although until now not much was made of it.",
                "\n\tYes, it does. People assume that because in our closest relatives, like chimpanzees and bonobos, the mother is the exclusive caretaker of her infant, that this must have been true of our ancestors as well. Indeed, the most influential models of infant care, such as Attachment Theory [which holds that a child needs a secure relationship with a single adult caregiver for normal social and emotional development to occur], came out of this assumption that the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness for humans was mother-only care. If you go to the American Museum of Natural History and you look at those wonderful panoramas\u2014panoramas that I love\u2014you'll see the mother hominin holding her infant, and her mate will be there, maybe with his arm draped around her shoulder. But she's the one doing all the caretaking.",
                "\n\tBut if you study hunter-gatherers still living that way today, or if you look at ethnographies from the middle of the 20th century when people were still living by hunting and gathering\u2014perhaps not exactly the same as our ancestors two million years ago but nevertheless our best proxies for how people in those environments kept their children alive\u2014if you look at the ethnographic evidence, care is provided by a range of group members, not just the mother.",
                "\n\tBut let me be clear. I don't think anyone would question that the mother is a central figure or that an infant becomes powerfully attached to the nurturing mother who suckles him. But the point is there are these allomothers in addition to the mother who, from a very early age, even before the infant is weaned, are kiss-feeding, providing sweetened saliva and little pre-masticated treats, responding to the infant, holding him and so forth so the mother is free to forage and perform other vital activities.",
                "\n\tI believe it was critically important. Human infants are born larger and even more helpless than any of the other apes, and yet when you compare the birth intervals in modern human hunter-gatherers with the birth intervals in any of the other great apes, you find that babies are weaned sooner and their mothers are breeding at a much faster pace than great apes. At the extreme end, the interbirth interval in an orangutan is seven to eight years, maybe five or six years in a chimpanzee. By contrast, the interbirth interval for human hunter-gatherers is closer to two or three years, suggesting that help from others, especially the supplementary feeding that allomothers provide, is allowing mothers to breed at a faster pace.",
                "\n\tWith their children buffered from starvation this way, populations could also persist even in the face of very challenging environments, and also migrate into novel habitats, and, of course, eventually out of Africa and around the globe.",
                "\n\tIf I had to sum up the human family in the Pleistocene, here's what I would stress: Family composition was flexible, and people were strategic. They moved away from adversity and towards opportunity, and the opportunities they moved towards were not just water resources, better food resources, more game, but also the alloparental resources. They counted on these others to help them to care for and provision their young and look out for them, even in the face of climate fluctuation and tremendously challenging environmental conditions. These families were flexible and dynamic, and I think this flexibility was the hallmark of the human family.",
                "\n\tOne of the most striking discoveries about chimpanzees in recent years has been how alert newborn babies are. They are able to scan the faces of others and even imitate them, just as we know human babies can do. But the difference is that in the context of chimpanzee social life, that baby is going to be primarily focused on its mother and can be relatively confident that as long as its mother is alive, she's going to care for it to the extent of her ability.",
                "\n\tHuman infants, human apes, were born in a totally different developmental context. Their mother's commitment was more contingent, as is also the case in other cooperatively breeding primates. Babies were off their mother more, needing to constantly monitor their mother's whereabouts as well as her emotional state and commitment, and they also needed to monitor others and their level of commitment and intentions. Who was likely to be worth soliciting something from, and who not? By having multiple attachment figures, even with the mother the central figure, they learned to read the emotions and attentions of others from an early, early age, creating a very different kind of ape phenotype. [Editor's note: Phenotype refers to an organism's visible characteristics and traits produced by the interaction of its genes with its environment.]",
                "\n\tSo I'm envisioning for Homo erectus a two-stage process. The development of the infant in a context with multiple caretakers producing a different phenotype, a little offspring conditioned to pay more attention to and monitor the intentions of others more\u2014that's the first step. And then in the second step, natural selection favors those individuals who are a little bit better at doing this, because they would be the little infants best cared for, best fed, and most likely to survive. So a different developmental process producing a novel ape phenotype, and then a novel selection pressure actually favoring the little apes better at things like theorizing about the minds of others.",
                "\n\tTheory of mind is being able to attribute a mental state to someone else. It's very interesting that the first studies of theory of mind were actually done in great apes. People trying to decide if one ape knew what another knew about where some food was hidden. As psychiatrists have developed this concept, they focused more on what I would call \"intersubjectivity.\"",
                "\n\tIn a way this is a more useful concept for thinking about early humans, because we want to know when people not only attributed intentions and mental states to others, but also began to care about what they thought and care about what that individual thought about them\u2014pride and shame. These are very human emotions, closely tied into empathy, so it's very hard to come up with separate definitions for theory of mind, intersubjectivity, empathy. These are all related, and all very much a part of what we think it means to be human and what I think of as emotionally modern.",
                "\n\tWhen did humans develop this gift for attributing mental states and feelings to others and for caring about what others thought about them? [These are] absolutely critical underpinnings for later developments like the spectacular capacity of humans to cooperate. This is a really important sociocognitive difference between humans and other apes. It's because we can read the intentions of others and we know what someone else is trying to do that we can work together with them to cooperate.",
                "\n\tAt present, kind of the reigning theory\u2014indeed, it's just about the only theory you hear about for how humans develop this capacity to cooperate\u2014is the idea that there were these competing groups, and the only way they could survive would be if they cooperated to, for example, kill off their neighbors.",
                "\n\tWell, maybe. It could be right. But it also could be wrong. This is why it strikes me as such a bad idea to have just one theory to explain something as important as the underpinnings of cooperation. So that is one reason why I have spent so much time exploring alternative hypotheses for the origins of human intersubjectivity and of this spectacular capacity humans have to cooperate with others, even strangers.",
                "\n\tWell, taking a long time growing up has real drawbacks, because you could die before you get a chance to breed. There are plenty of chances to starve in there. On the other hand, taking a long time to grow up means that if food is short, you could just slow down for a while and grow a little less, take your time, and have a catch-up period when food becomes more abundant. You can build a stronger system, stronger body, stronger immune system.",
                "\n\tAnd then, I think, there was a special bonus from taking so long. A number of anthropologists argue that the reason human childhoods are so long is because we need that period to grow our big brains in order to fill it with the useful cultural and linguistic information that humans need to succeed in life.",
                "\n\tMaybe so, but I have wondered if what really happened wasn't that because human childhoods were so long\u2014and we know, by the way, that among cooperatively breeding animals generally, you have longer periods of post-weaning dependency, or what in birds is post-fledging dependency, and in humans what we call childhood\u2014that maybe having a longer childhood to start with meant that humans could have the luxury of evolving a bigger brain.",
                "\n\tOne of the drawbacks about big brains is that they are so costly. And if you had to take longer to grow up so that you could grow a big brain, I'm not sure that they would ever pay off, because some just slightly faster-growing but stupider lout could breed successfully before you did. But if childhoods were already long to begin with, then you could have selection favoring larger brains.",
                "\n\tI do. I think longer childhoods came as a by-product of being a cooperative breeder and that because we had longer childhoods, there was a wonderful opportunity for big brains to evolve\u2014even though they only had a slight advantage initially, because the thing about brains is, growth is incremental, and the benefits might not show up from having a little bit bigger brain, especially when that other lout was going to outbreed you.",
                "\n\tIn my view, big brains need caring much more than caring requires big brains.",
                "\n\tWhen you look across cooperative breeders, marmosets and tamarins, for example, these guys have tiny brains, brains no bigger than a walnut. And yet they are very caring and sensitive to the needs of others and, in that sense, pre-adapted for social learning. You probably know that when one macaque or chimpanzee stares into the eyes of another, this is a sign of aggression, right? Marmosets are the only primate besides humans where you can stare into somebody else's eyes and it's not taken as aggression. It's a way of communicating.",
                "\n\tSo what I'm arguing in terms of, say, humans and marmosets is that if you take an ape with the cognitive sophistication that we know that chimpanzees and orangutans have\u2014a very good sense of causality, quantitative skills that rival [those of] a two-and-a-half-year-old human child, the ability to make tools, rudimentary theory of mind, rudimentary empathy\u2014and then you take that ape and you introduce a cooperative-breeding child-rearing system such as you have in marmosets that encourages increased emphasis on sharing, sharing not just food but also information, you have a novel combination of the cognitive expertise of an ape with the giving impulses of a cooperative breeder\u2014that is what I think was happening to humans at the beginning of the Pleistocene.",
                "\n\tIt's an opportunistic windfall, but one our species subsequently made the most of. Clearly our entire 1,300-centimeter brain didn't evolve just as a bonus from cooperative breeding. Lots else was going on that favored intelligent individuals. But what I'm saying is that long childhoods, this period when youngsters were buffered from starvation by alloparental as well as parental provisioning, provided a novel opportunity for brains to get bigger.",
                "\n\tThere was just so much emphasis on hunting and warfare that we overlooked how important child-rearing was. After all, in evolutionary terms, offspring survival is where the rubber hits the road.",
                "\n\tSo much of the literature on human evolution stresses hunting and intergroup fighting and mate choice and competition for mates that we tend to forget that unless the offspring conceived survive, all these activities are just so much sound and fury signifying nothing.",

The first flaw is that many of these organisations whether they be national high profile ones such as Stonewall, or lesser known ones catering for smaller groups such as Bisexuals, are aligned with the political Left. The second flaw in these organisations, possibly because they are aligned to the Left, is that a good many of them have a major blind spot when it comes to the threat to the lives and security of LGB people posed by the ideology of Islam and its accompanying Shariah Law.",

Groups like Stonewall and BiCon the National Bisexual Convention are firmly in the leftist identity politics camp and often shy away from the controversial but very necessary task of speaking up against Islam and of warning LGB people of the threat that Islam poses to LGB people. This \u2018I see no Islam\u2019 attitude by these groups is harming the long term security of LGB people and making themselves less representative of the concerns of a growing number of LGB people about the ideology of Islam.",

Shariah Law and Islamisation are today\u2019s joint number one threat to the safety and security of LGB people and at last people are starting to speak up against these threats. One such manifestation of a recognition that the establishment LGB groups are not representing or protecting LGB people properly is event that is going to happen on June 10th 2017. This is the Gays Against Shariah demonstration which is to take place in Manchester in the Gay Village area of the city.",

In that attack the Islamic attacker, Omar Mateen, took the lives of 49 innocent people who were just enjoying a night out. The attack on the club in Orlando woke up many individual LGB people as to the scale of the lethal threat posed to LGB people from the ideology of Islam and its followers. The effects of Shariah Law, a legal code that condemns gay people to death merely for being gay is something that needs to be countered and fought against.",

It\u2019s time for new groups to deal with new threats to safety and security and Gays Aginst Shariah is one of those.

                "Before sunrise every day, Joudeh takes the church\u2019s centuries-old cast iron key his family has safe\u00adguarded and meets Nuseibeh at the church door to perform the same ritual. Nuseibeh uses the iron key, which is 30 centimetres long, with a triangular metal handle and a square end to unlock the door. ",

                "The church is declared open at 4am and closes at 8pm, when a similar ritual is performed. ",
                "Muslims have been entrusted with the key since 1187, primar\u00adily because of disputes between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholics on who should keep it. The differences threatened to keep the church and its shrine closed, according to the Muslim clergy, church officials and records. ",
                "The dispute still exists and en\u00adcompasses many aspects of life shared by the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholics residing in the church. ",
                "Church officials joke in private on the extent of disagreements between the Orthodox and the Catholics, which were manifested by a wooden ladder placed on the church\u2019s back wall by a worker, who fixed a window on the second floor in 1757, but forgot to remove it. Under papal instructions not to take it away, the \u201cimmovable lad\u00adder\u201d remained where it was to be\u00adcome a feature of the shrine. ",
                "Joudeh said his family inherited the key from an ancestor in 1187, who was entrusted with the task by Muslim commander Saladin, who forced the Crusader Kingdom of Je\u00adrusalem to surrender to his forces. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin was the sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayy\u00adubid dynasty. ",
                "Nuseibeh, however, said his fam\u00adily had the \u201cprestigious privilege\u201d to protect the key well before the Joudehs \u2014 since 637. He said it was given to one of his ancestors by the Muslim caliph at the time. ",
                "\u201cThe Nuseibeh family considers the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as its home,\u201d Nuseibeh said. ",
                "Jamal Khader, a Roman Catholic priest who is the dean of College of Arts at Bethlehem University, said the two Muslim families were en\u00adtrusted with the church as a \u201csym\u00adbol of Muslim-Christian coexist\u00adence\u201d. ",
                "\u201cUsually, the owner of a house is the one who holds its key,\u201d he said, insisting that allowing the key to remain with Muslims was initially because of Christian conflict but later developed into a feeling of trust. ",
                "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to change the status quo because it works perfect\u00adly well,\u201d Khader said.\n\n"

                "Donald Trump has been tweeting about Kristen Stewart since 2012, despite not knowing her. But now that he's president, Stewart, who isn't usually one to take political positions, addressed him directly in her Saturday Night Live monologue, saying that if he didn't like her seven years ago, then he will like her even less now, because, as she says, \"I'm so gay, dude.\"",
                "The Twilight actress hasn't always been so open about her sexuality. This is the first time she's publicly embraced any label. Queer rumors followed the actress back since she was dating her Twilight costar, Robert Pattinson, the actor who Stewart claims Trump is obsessed with. Stewart talked about her sexuality for the first time in 2015, when she appeared on the September cover of Nylon. She told the magazine, \"Google me, I'm not hiding,\" when asked if she is queer. At the time, photos of her and her then-girlfriend, Alicia Cargile, were all over the internet.\u00a0",

                "That phrase, \"Google me, I'm not hiding,\" took on special meaning for Stewart, who later admitted that she purposely wanted the paparazzi to take photos of her with Soko, a French pop star Stewart dated after she and Cargile broke up, because that was a way for her to be out without having to say it. \"That's really important to me,\" she told Variety\u00a0about having her young fans see her holding hands with or kissing another woman. \"As much as I want to protect myself, it's not about hiding. As soon as you start throwing up so many walls, you cannot see over them yourself, so you just start isolating in a way that's not honest.\"\u00a0",
                "In the same interview with Variety in 2016, the actress opened up and said that when she was dating men, she never talked about her relationships to anyone. She said, at the time, that she felt the same about dating women. \"I'm not hiding shit,\" she told the magazine. \"I'm very obviously...\" she said, before trailing off without saying the word \"gay\" or \"queer.\"\u00a0",
                "But that changed months later, when she did an interview with T, the New York Times style magazine. She spoke about Cargile, with whom she had often been photographed. \"Look how cute she is,\" she told the publication, while showing photos of the two together from a private Instagram account. \"I love her so much,\" she said. Stewart got back together with Cargile after breaking up with Soko.\u00a0",
                "Stewart's position about not speaking publicly about her relationships changed when she began dating women because \"it seemed like there was an opportunity to represent something really positive,\" Stewart told the Times. While the actress was known for usually keeping mum about her personal life, she didn't want to seem homophobic by not speaking about it. \"I still want to protect my personal life, but I don't want to seem like I'm protecting the idea, so that does sort of feel like I owe something to people.\"\u00a0",
                "While promoting her movie Equals, Stewart was asked about the process of opening up the media about her relationships with women. \"I've discovered a way to live my life and not feel like I'm hiding at all,\" she told the Los Angeles Times. \"And I think that's pretty apparent for anyone who cares \u2014 not that everyone does. But I think that if you had been tracking it in any way, it's more apparent that I'm more relaxed than I used to be.\"",
                "Stewart's fans have definitely been tracking it. It's because when Stewart opens up about being queer, it lets her fans, especially her queer fans, know that there's no need to hide your sexuality, even when you have a president who reportedly is\u00a0considering signing an anti-LGBT \"religious freedom\" order that would make it legal to discriminate against LGBT people.\u00a0",
