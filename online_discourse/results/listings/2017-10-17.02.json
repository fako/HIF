                    "The 2004 election saw religion and politics clash in Australia like never before, and riding the crest of the values wave was the evangelical Christian group Family First. This one-hour special goes behind the scenes 3 months before the election charting the rise of an unknown political party to its place in the senate.",

                    "  Introduction:Hello. I'm Geraldine Doogue. This week on Compass, we're tackling the big questionï¿½ how much should religion and politics mix? Last year as we waited for John Howard to call the federal election, few Australians thought that religion would effect the outcome. Then a surprise player entered the sceneï¿½ 12 weeks before the election a bold group of Christians formed Family First. Tonight Compass brings you an exclusive. A program that goes into the heart of Family First. Witnessing the birth and rise of this new political entity.  Narrator:Religion and Politics have always been an un-easy mix in Australia.In the lead up to the 2004 Federal election there was a substantial shift in the Australian political landscape. Conservative Christianity went on a crusade into the mostly secular world of Australian politics.Front and centre in the march of the Christian soldiers was the Family First Party which was born out of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God church.From a standing start only twelve weeks out from the poll, the FamilyFirst strategists put a carefully orchestrated plan into action to try andwin enough seats in the federal senate to give them the balance of power.Australian politics was about to change.  John Harrison: An awful lot of people in the media were happy to write off Family First as a bunch of Right wing fundamentalist loonies. Thatï¿½s probably because the Assemblies of God Church believe that the bible is the literal and inspired word of God and that you must be born again and speak in tongues. They tend to be very conservative voters. One commentator even talked about them as One Nation of prayer. But again with One Nation the media misread the mood of the nation. John Cleary:I think there is a deal of middle class concern in Australia about where Australia is going. Middle class people have got the money but theyï¿½re saying we did something with the values thing. You know where concerned about where our kids are going and what the future will be for our kids. Now there is evidence of a deep hunger for some sense of moral and spiritual core however that is reflected and I think there is a sense of Family First picking up on those sorts of issuesï¿½ Narrator:Family First werenï¿½t the only ones responding the values barometer of the nation. In the months leading up to the election, Federal Treasurer Peter Costello appeared at the evangelical Hillsongs conference in Sydney to an audience of more than fourteen thousand.Peter Costello: We need a return to faith and values which have made our country strong. Narrator:It seemed that the time was right for a well organised, conservative, family values party and Family First answered the call.The Party was conceived in Adelaide and emerged from the Paradise Assemblies of God church. Retired pastor Andrew Evans and newly mantled senior pastor, his son Ashley, felt a simultaneous call of God to plant their cross in state parliament.Andrew Evans: All I know is that when you get a desire for a long period of time that keeps returning to you. Youï¿½ve got to investigate and take a lot of notice it because it could be a God thing.Ashley Evans: Just every morning that Iï¿½d wake up I had this very very strong kind of overpowering sense that more needed to be done for the families of Australia. More needed to be down and something had to happen not just in the realm that I operate which is you know people in the community and a spiritual perspective, but from a values perspective and from a perspective that would engage in the political debate over important issues.Andrew Evans: Both of us coming from different directions had the same thought that we should get involved in the political process, because of the trends that we happening in society we needed to have a strong conservative socially conservative voice there. Narrator:Andrew Evans won a seat in the South Australian Upper House on his first attempt and with one other independent member now holds the balance of power. It was perceived as a miracle in any oneï¿½s book and served as the inspiration to pursue that bigger and more powerful sphere of influence ï¿½ the federal senate.After a thorough screening process based on political potential and personal morality, state Senate Candidates were selected from within the Christian evangelical ranks.Andrea Mason has a law degree and works in state parliament. She is passionate about family and indigenous issues.For twenty nine years, John Lewis has been senior pastor of an Assemblies of God church in Brisbane. He sees himself as a social and morals crusader.Steve Fielding describes himself as a family man who works in marketing. He became a local councilor in Knox city in 2002.And Jacqui Petrusma is a registered nurse and mother of four with degrees in education and commerce. She is national sales manager for a pharmaceutical company.Twelve weeks out from the election, the new Family First Senate candidates met in Melbourne to spend two days thrashing out policy and party rules.Party Meeting: Accessibility affordability via means testing and a mix of private and public systems.It was to Family Firstï¿½s federal chairman Peter Harris to get the new recruits into shape. Peter Harris is a property developer and his own Family First credentials are strongly underpinned by his prominent role in Adelaideï¿½s Paradise church. Peter Harris:Today weï¿½ve got the number one senate candidates together for the first time really that theyï¿½ve come together as a collective unit. And weï¿½re talking about what are the things that are important to the Family First party. What are the things we want to be known for and I guess really fine tuning what our position is on those issues, and then we are going to have some media training so that we have a collective message and we clearly understand how we want to articulate our message in the public domain. Discussion in party meeting:ï¿½We want to defend our Christian schools to not have to employ homosexuals.ï¿½ï¿½But we canï¿½t legislate about thatï¿½ï¿½But they give their values to the childrenï¿½ï¿½The Greens have specifically said they want gays in Christian schools they make that a clear goalï¿½ï¿½I send my Christian school I want them to be brought up in a Christian environment. I think the community expects thatï¿½ï¿½And Muslims want the same choice tooï¿½ï¿½Any religious based institution is allowed the freedom of choice to employ those who are closely aligned to their belief systems. Something like thatï¿½ Andrew Bolt: People are concerned about Family First, the ones that really worry about Family First, because these are people that actually believe, and they believe in the Bible, they believe in Christianity, theyï¿½re not once-a-month, go to church type people, they are believers. And thatï¿½s seen as something spooky to a lot of others. Itï¿½s seen as people who might insist on rules (laughs) might insist on morality and I think a lot of people get freaked by that. Discussion in meeting: ï¿½But there are a lot of people that seriously canï¿½t take their kids to the doctor because they canï¿½t afford it.ï¿½ Peter Harris: If we achieve one or two senate seats I would be over the moon, because itï¿½s not an easy area to break into. And I think itï¿½s the right timing because I get a sense that people are looking for something else and that people are despondent about whatï¿½s available and I know weï¿½ve heard it all before but we actually have a network of people that are going to be around the nation and communicating with the nation and I think that this could be a history making time for Australian politics.Discussion in meeting: ï¿½Social justice on page 17ï¿½ï¿½Have we got a policy on should say sorry to the Aboriginal people?ï¿½ï¿½My position is Iï¿½m concerned about what the repercussions are of actually saying sorry in terms of compensation and all of the other issues. Cause there must be a clear reason why our prime minister has taken this point of view.ï¿½ï¿½This issue of saying that there are significant financial implication of saying sorry then weï¿½ve got to look at limiting those because why should the families of today suffer with those financial burdens and two wrongs donï¿½t make a right.ï¿½ï¿½We didnï¿½t stand up and give voice to those that were being mistreated and so as a nation there is a sense of national shame. Maybe not on an individual basis but on a corporate basis there is. And so we would ask the head of our political system, the head of government, the prime minister of Australia to apologise in terms of the national issue but not necessarily on a personal level.ï¿½ï¿½To me, if youï¿½ve done something wrong thereï¿½s a consequence to it, and isnï¿½t that what we want the principle to be in our families? The bulk of people think that we only think right wing issues, but we actually do care about the environment, I actually do care about saying us sorry on this issue, we do care about social justice issues and all those sorts of things. And we may as well not have a policy on this if we donï¿½t believe that we should not say an un-reserved sorry.ï¿½ John Cleary:The real dilemma for Christians as to whether they join political parties and become sort of the salt of the earth within that party, or they form distinct Christian parties. The history of Christian parties has not been a very good one. In Australian context we only have to look at the DLP but if you go to Europe and you look at parties like the Christian Democrats and others, the compromise and deals necessary in politics have usually inevitably corrupted those Christian groups who want to go into politics as a Christian party. Itï¿½s not been a good history. Narrator:Tasmanian senate candidate Jacqui Petrusma knows what itï¿½s like to do it tough ï¿½ after the break-up of her first marriage she was a single mother for nine years. It was during that difficult period that she became a committed Christian. Jacqui had been told that her last pregnancy needed to be terminated because tests indicated that her unborn child had Downï¿½s Syndromeï¿½Jacqui Petrusma: And the whole way up until I was 24 weeks, the doctors were still saying to me all the time you need to have an abortion. My mother whoï¿½s actually head of the mid-wiffery units in one of the hospital, you know sheï¿½s a mid wife and she was saying you need to have an abortion. And then of course she was born without down syndrome and it really shows you that this is a fight against the powers of darkness, and you know we need to be out there you praying interceding, trying to make a difference. Family First isnï¿½t a Christian party, itï¿½s been started up by Christians. All the people running for parliament are Christians, however we see ourselves as a values based party. Because basically we know we have to be as wise as a snake but gentle as a dove, because if weï¿½ve got to get out there to the world and try and change values, we canï¿½t go out there being a Christian party cause most of the world will wipe us off. John Cleary: Family First gained their support base through mobilizing networks through the Assemblies of God. Yet when they presented themselves to the Australian public they attempted to disguise that. Now some people are going to be cynical about this. Now hang on lets be honest here. You are either a political party that is Christian and are proud of it, or you are a conservative party using Christian networks and trying to disguise it. John Harrison: Australians generally despise wowsers. And Family First deliberately tried not to look too Christain. Based on the experience of the electorate with Fred Nile, who was so overtly Christian, that it turned people off. Now that policy of not being overtly Christian in fact cost them votes amongst the Christian subculture. Narrator:John Lewis was a sheet-metal worker when he was first called to be a Pentecostal pastor. He is now on the national executive of the Assemblies of God. John tends his flock at Brisbaneï¿½s Northside Christian church and setup their extensive social program and school.  John Lewis:Being a pastor in this Church for almost 30 years, qualifies me to at least to talk about the everyday issues that families face. The divorce issues, the breakdown, the children problem, the drugs, alcohol problem. And I could see that we could improve greatly the possibilities of the future for our young people with good legislation, excellent education, bringing in things that will help them to become better citizens for the fututre. Narrator:With less than eight weeks until the federal election, most of Australian had not yet heard of the Family First Party. A nationwide launch was designed to capture the hearts and minds of the mostly bussed-in church faithful and the initially cautious attention of the television media. John Lewis chose to arrive in full presidential hoopla style with the desired result.  John Harrison: The Pentecostals really know how to swing it. They are major entrepreneurs. Hillsong church produces a weekly tv show, got ARIA award winning albums with world wide circulation. Paradise church is the home of Guy Sebastian. These people donï¿½t wait for the media spotlight, they set it up and switch it on themselves.John Harris Political speech: Family First is not just another political party, our priority is the health, well-being and commonwealth of all Australian families. John Cleary:Whatï¿½s interesting about Family First is that they are almost, they are almost the product of a sort of market-driven Christianity, thatï¿½s, thatï¿½s very familiar in the Pentecostal scene, that is, itï¿½s very freewheeling, very built on Charismatic figures and Charismatic leadership. So I, I think in, in terms of church terms you can understand where itï¿½s come from. Whatï¿½s very interesting is to how it, whether it can, in fact, graft itself in to the Australian political psyche.  Narrator:The Launch in Melbourne saw dozens of the new party faithful clambering to sign up as party members and polling booth workers. Peter Harris:We care about a value driven society. We care about the definition of marriage. We care about the issues that affect everyday Australians. We care about what is happening in our schools and how we teach our children about sex and all those sorts of issuesSteve Fielding: Itï¿½s time, itï¿½s time for a change. Itï¿½s time as a nation we started to put families first. Narrator:Although heï¿½s a born again Christian, Steve Fielding is the only state senate candidate not from the Assemblies of God. His recent position with local council means that heï¿½s the only candidate with any practical political experience. Steve Fielding: Growing up in a family of sixteen children you learn the art of politics and the arts of numbers, your parents would not listen unless there was enough of you wanting to go a certain way. So you quickly learnt that if you needed to get something done you needed to have the numbers. Narrator:Steve and his family live in Melbourneï¿½s Eastern suburbs. Though he is a qualified engineer Steve has worked as a general manager of Victoriaï¿½s largest superannuation fund for the past three years.Steve Fielding: The way the Australian political system works, it needs a legitimate third party. And with the Democrats I suppose, losing I suppose credibility with the electorate, a lot of people feel as if I suppose they theyï¿½ve abused the trust that people placed, they are looking for a third party. And up until this stage theyï¿½ve only had the Greens to really look at. And we want to be a positive third party and pull out the best from the left and pull the best out of the right. So we want to pull the best from Labor and Liberal and I guess thatï¿½s where Family First would really sit Narrator:In a house in the North Eastern suburbs of Adelaide, the federal office of Family First is a-buzz with word that their South Australian party launch made it into the national press.Andrea Masonï¿½s appointment as Federal leader of the party in 2004 confounded those critics who had prematurely categorised Family First as ignorant right wingers. Andrea already had a public profile as a former International netballer.She brings to the party a strong Christian heritage. Her father was a famous pastor in the outback missions of Australia. For Andrea the upholding of family values has a uniquely aboriginal perspective. Andrea Mason:This is a great nation and there has been a lot of things that have happened in this country, both positive and negative and Family First has an opportunity to be a part of that. And I believe that what we want to do is very positive and I think that as we get out into the community and start to speak to people things will start to make sense to them in terms of what we want to do. Narrator:Andrea is a worship leader at Paradise Community church but in the lead-up to the election was asked to speak at a number of Assemblies of God churches about her political ambitions.Andrea in church:I come from Kalgoolie, Western Australia, a mining town a rough mining town. And now Iï¿½m standing here today as someone who possibly on the threshold of going into federal politics, as the first Indigenous woman ever in the 103 years history of this country to do that. How does that happen? Things donï¿½t just happen/ Narrator:The appearance of Family First candidates in church pulpits fuelled the debate about the separation of church and state. Andrew Bolt: People who say keep religion out of politics, I donï¿½t understand. I donï¿½t understand what theyï¿½re saying because we all act out of some sort of moral belief which usually is informed by some sort of religion or the vestiges of, of a religion, and to say, no, youï¿½ve got to take that part of your personality, that part, part of your beliefs, of your morality and put that to one side, whatï¿½s left? What are you using to judge whether things are good or bad?\t John Harrison: There was this tradition in Australian politics that you didnï¿½t wear your religious faith on your sleeve. I mean everybody knew that the Labor party members were all Catholic, it didnï¿½t need to be said, you didnï¿½t have to stand up and say Iï¿½m a Catholic. The fact that they were Labor meant that they were Catholic almost by definition. But weï¿½ve seen a change and itï¿½s a change which I think reflects some of the sorts of changes we are seeing in politics in the US. And we are seeing people being much more open about their religious beliefs and their religious values. John Cleary:The traditional tensions that exist between church and state, I think, are best articulated by the South African experience of Desmond Tutu. For years, when South Africa was under the apartheid regime, Desmond Tutu and priests in the Anglican church, actively supported the move for change and they were called Communists and they were called everything else. Once the ANC had achieved government in South Africa, Desmond Tutu instructed his priests to sever their links with the ANC, and when he was asked why, he said, ï¿½The church must always maintain a critical collaboration with governmentï¿½, that is, itï¿½s got to always stand independent of government and not be seen as an agent of government, so that it can critically evaluate government. John Harrison: The political landscape was quite interesting. The coalition was perceived to be somewhat on the back foot, under the pressure of the new Labor Leader with his reading to children, his triangulation of politics. The minor parties were even more interesting. The Greens were on the up and up and there was a perception that the Labor party could get across the line with Green preferences. The Democrats were gone for all money and Andrew Bartlett was reduced to doing bungee jumping to get them on television. One Nation was a write off, Pauline Hanson was reduced to chatting up truckies at truck stops. And then out of right field came Family First.  Narrator:The election clock was ticking and the realities of campaign costs were setting in. It was time for Family First to rally the troops. Candidates and party officials were dispatched to fundraising dinners around the country.  Peter Harris: I donï¿½t know if you realize but we have got the potential to determine the next government of Australia. Do you believe that? The major parties and their senior leaders are in dialogue with us right now over these coming next 10 days, talking with us about where we are going to make our preferences. The media are chasing us about where we are going to preference. Narrator:The assembled were politely asked to put their money where their morals were ï¿½.Fundraiser Man:Out of this room, imagine if every person said I can put a thousand bucks on my credit card. That would bring in a significant amount. But more than that, imagine if every Church leader or business leader here said weï¿½re good for ten. Imagine if there were some people here tonight that could, with a stretch, say I could put one hundred k in. Narrator:As election campaigning went into full swing, Tasmanian candidate Jacqui Petrusmaï¿½s kitchen became her war room.Meeting at Jacquiï¿½s: ï¿½Family First nationwide have looked at Tasmania and they actually believe that they have the best chance of succeeding in Tasmania. That they contact that weï¿½ve been having as a party from the major parties, are very concerned where our preferences are going to goï¿½ï¿½People are taking us very seriously, they know that weï¿½re going to appeal to voters that Liberal, Labor, Greens and the Democrats wonï¿½t. These a big group of people who are disenfranchised with all the parties and thatï¿½s who we are going after.ï¿½ Narrator:The Senate draw in Brisbane was an opportunity to do some final wheeling and dealing for crucial preferences, the lifeblood of minor parties.The party felt that John Lewis had a strong chance of winning a Queensland senate seat until the political waters were muddied by the surprise re-emergence of Pauline Hanson. Her presence sent the media into a feeding frenzy.As the recently imprisoned ex-leader of the One Nation party it seemed that she still commanded a significant following. Paul Harrison: Australian Politics sometimes creates strange bedfellows. The only chance Family First had in the Senate, was to swap preferences with other the minor parties. And that was always going to be risky. Some of their Church based followers were critical of their deal with the democrats for instance who had policies in favor of gay marriage and euthanasia. John Cleary: Politics is essentially the art of compromise. Puritanism in politics will always put you on the margin, always put you on the margin. Now, if that's where you want to be, as for instance, the Australian Democrats, for many years, when, when they said, 'Our job's to keep the bastards honest', they actually knew where they were, they were going to be pure, on the margin players. As soon as you attempt to say, 'No, we're going to become the mainstream, then, inevitably, you've got to do deals to do that and there's a sense in which that becomes, then, very problematic for parties that have a very idealistic basis. Narrator:The only two Liberals not preferenced by Family First were sitting member Warren Entsch a supporter of gay marriage and Dr Ingrid Tall who is openly gay. Narrator:Family First had identified the Greens as their major political rival and made a frontal attack to reveal their supposedly hidden agenda.Family First Ads:  Thatï¿½s not green Bob, thatï¿½s extreme. John Harrison: Family first spent $600 000 on advertising in the campaign, much of it on negative advertising attacking the Greens. Now thatï¿½s almost twice as much as the Greens own advertising budget and four times the advertising budget of the Democrats Andrew Bolt: Family First were right to go in hard against the Greens, because it is a competing ideology, itï¿½s a competing religion. Fundamentally, those, those are the two big religions grasping for the votes of the religiously uncommitted in this society. It works like this, GK Chesterton, the great Roman Catholic writer, said that when man stops believing in God, he doesnï¿½t believe in nothing, heï¿½ll believe in anything, and whatï¿½s come to fill that vacuum? The Greens. John Harrison: Attack advertising has a very long and disreputable history in political campaigning and itï¿½s been used very successfully for example in American Presidential campaigns. Now what we know about attack advertising is that it actually works, itï¿½s very effective. So there is no doubt that the attack advertising that the Family First party ran was effective in diminishing the Greens vote. But, the long term problem is that it contributes to the on going public cynicism about politics and the electoral process. So here you have a party that really wants to promote positive values, which is in actual fact by itï¿½s own campaign, undermining a sense of well being about political system.Bob Brown on ï¿½Meet the Pressï¿½: Let me just talk about Family First, itï¿½s an unchristian group. It seems to be motivated by hate. It has been talking with the Prime Minister about how to get extra representation in the parliament. Because the Prime Minister wants to use Family First to get control of the senate. Family First I believe their policies actually threaten young Australians, where the Greens are trying to minimize that threat.  Narrator:Family First were still having problems with their profile. Their media events and press conferences were largely ignored. Even when they brought out the big guns like Brisbane Lion and high profile Christian, Shaun Hart. Candidates were frustrated at not being able to get their message across to the electorate.John Harrison: Thereï¿½s an old saying, be careful what you prayer for, you might get it. Now by the last week of the campaign, the question for Family First was, is any publicity good publicity?  Narrator:The national spotlight fell on Family First finally when a Brisbane party volunteer made a comment at a pre-polling booth that lesbians like Ingrid Tall should be burnt at the stake along with all the other witches. Radio interview:  John Lewis:Let me clearly make it known, the expression that all lesbians ought to be burnt at the stake is a total misrepresentation of Family First.Drew Hutton: If John is saying that there not anti lesbian, then why on earth is Ingrid Tall not getting preferences? John Lewis:Ingrid Tall would not represent the family values that we represent.Drew Hutton: Because sheï¿½s a lesbian. John Lewis:Because sheï¿½s a lesbian.Drew Hutton: So you are opposed to people on the basis of their sexuality, not on what they do, but on the basis of their sexuality. I think that is totally intolerant and unchristian myself. John Lewis:Well I donï¿½t think itï¿½s unchristian.Drew Hutton: Well I do. Iï¿½m married to a Christian, there are plenty of Christianï¿½s who believe in tolerance, inclusiveness justice and not being judgmental to people about something over which they have not control. Narrator:The radio switchboard went into meltdown as the people of Brisbane weighed in on the spirited debate.Gay Activists, the Greens and the Socialist alliance responded immediately with a rally and some political street theatre outside Brisbaneï¿½s Liberal Party headquarters. Adding fuel to the media flames were revelations that a religious tract issued by Family First candidate Danny Nalliah had implored Christians to pray to bring down ï¿½Satanï¿½s strongholdsï¿½ including bottleshops, brothels and Buddhist Temples.  Peter Harris:The day after some stuff happened up in Queensland. You know stupid comments and we dealt with that immediately. I had a meeting with the Prime Minister and as I walked into his office he said welcome to politics. And he said we have people who make silly comments as well. And he totally understand and I guess has a degree of empathy with the situation that we were facing at that particular moment about people that were making loose comments and using language that we wouldnï¿½t want them to use that represent the party.John Howard: There is one particular issue that was raised by Mr Harris with me a couple of weeks ago. And that is the desirability of having formal family impact statements in cabinet submissions. In a sense we do that already but in a informal way, and Iï¿½ve said that weï¿½d be very happy to do it and I think itï¿½s a good suggestionLaurie Oaks interview with PM on Sunday: Do you think itï¿½s healthy for Australian democracy to have a religious party, a party closely associated with the Assemblies of God Church? Iï¿½ve got a letter from the Family First Queensland Senate candidate John C Lewis to a church minister and he says in that among other things ï¿½that thereï¿½s a need for a voice in Canberra that upholds the family unit of our society based on biblical standards.ï¿½ Is that what you want?John Howard: I want the policies that I practise for 30 years. I mean put the family at the centre of national life but I donï¿½t go around preaching you know that. Narrator:After an erratic week under intense media scrutiny one thing was certain ï¿½ most of Australia had now heard of Family First.Andrea sought the pre-election blessing of her Christian friends at a modest church gathering. Andrea Mason:October 9th, the day has arrived. And I feel quietly excited about today and how today is going to unfold. But this process has been quite challenging and demanding and I know that Iï¿½ve grown as a person, changed as a person, and been influenced to look at life in different ways. So I know that Andrea Mason isnï¿½t the same as I was 6 weeks ago or even two months ago.  Narrator:One of Andreaï¿½s mentors prominent indigenous elder Lowitja Oï¿½Donoghue made no secret of her disappointment with the partyï¿½s policies.Lowitja Oï¿½Donoghue: I support you personally, I donï¿½t support the party and Iï¿½m not happy about your campaign against the Greens. And preferences to Howard is just not on, as far as Iï¿½m concerned. Heï¿½s not been good for indigenous issues hasnï¿½t been good for refugees and all the rest of it. Narrator:In the seat of Brisbane, FF candidate Charles Newington came face to face with gay activists still reeling from the previous weekï¿½s anti-gay publicity.In Adelaide, Family First candidate banners were set alight and volunteers in Melbourne had flaming matches flicked at them in a gesture motivated by the burning lesbian comments. Peter Harris: Itï¿½s been a pretty torrid six weeks. Weï¿½ve done everything in our capacity to make this campaign work. Weï¿½re young and weï¿½re fresh and weï¿½ve done it differently. Prime Minister said to me that weï¿½ve made a lot of noise and thatï¿½s what we wanted. Made some mistakes along the way, but overall weï¿½ve got our message out and I get a sense that the people of Australia get a sense of what we are sayingï¿½ Narrator:As Election night unfolded it became very clear that the conservative coalition government would be returned with an increased majority and that the debut of Family First had made a surprising impact.In North Adelaide the party faithful gathered to celebrate perceived answers to their collective prayers as their partyï¿½s influence became evident.ABC TV Maxine McCue interview with Andrea Mason: Andrea Mason youï¿½ve been tuning in, clearly a very very positive for a first time party. Why do you think youï¿½ve been so successful first time round? Andrea Mason:Australia is deciding that they want to have a family friendly parliament. And Family First is part of this new wave of parties wanting to really promote family policies in our federal parliament. And thatï¿½s pleasing for us that weï¿½re part of this new wave of change  Narrator:The Family First executives watched on as the big screen showed the extent of their success. Family First executive watching: ï¿½Weï¿½re matching the Greensï¿½ï¿½And weï¿½re killing the Democratsï¿½ï¿½We won that seat for the Liberalï¿½sï¿½ï¿½For the radical left it was a bad nightï¿½ï¿½Bobï¿½s is back in the forest.ï¿½ï¿½But whatever happens if we get the one senate seat. Guess what? The world has changedï¿½ï¿½As I keep on saying 7 weeks ago, we did not existï¿½ Narrator:At the close of election night counting Family First had achieved over 2.5% across the contested seats and their preferences had determined the outcome in at least eight seats. Three senate candidates were still polling strongly and it seemed that they may have achieved their impossible dream ï¿½ the balance of power. John Harrison: When it looked like Family First would have the balance of power in the senate, they started to roll out some of their proposed policies. Andrea Mason said that they may approve the full sale of Telstra in exchange for an official sorry from the Prime Minister to our Indigenous people. And there was talk of a Child Abuse royal commission and having an asylum seeker summit. But of course all bets were off, when the coalition won power in the senate in itï¿½s own right. But it would have been an interesting upper house if Family First had actually had the balance of power Narrator:The Holy Grail of their fervent crusade had eluded them. It was a bitter blow for the party and the individual candidates.Andrea Masonï¿½s personal vote was high and sheï¿½d polled strongly overall but ultimately missed out on a South Australian senate seat. Andrea Mason: Obviously when you put a plan together and a strategy the whole goal is to get to the end an having succeeded. But we can certainly take away from this campaign so many positive things. Narrator:Andrea is back at her job in State Parliament and will continue to build the profile of Family First. Sheï¿½s determined to stand at the next Federal election. Jacqui Petrusma fell short of a senate seat by only 300 votes. She is set to launch an out and out assault at the Tasmanian state election.Jacqui Petrusma: Went from not being involved in politics at all, and then all of a sudden being catapulted to nearly winning a senate seat. So that was a fantastic opportunity and itï¿½s given us a fantastic grounding for being set up for the state. Narrator:After a hard fought but ultimately unsuccessful campaign John Lewis has decided to retire from his church. He is currently considering a future in Queensland state politics. John Lewis: I think Queensland is looking for a positive alterative to what they have and if we could come up with a good clear voice and good clear policies, I think we could do a lot of good for this state of Queenslandï¿½ Narrator:The real success story was Steve Fielding, who astonished the analysts by creating a preference flow which secured him a Victorian senate seat with only 1.9% of the vote. As the sole Senator elect it is now his responsibility to carry the torch of Family First into the senate. Steve Fielding on TV: I can say to the Australian people that we are not a puppet of any other political party Peter Harris: People are already talking about in the party lets get geared up for the next federal campaign and make sure we go for it and theyï¿½re putting in infrastructure now to make it happen and weï¿½re only talking about 2 weeks from the election. So thereï¿½s this enormous momentum thatï¿½s built out of this. Not only in our frame, but in the frame of the media, in the frame of politics, in the frame of how corporations are going to operate. A whole range of people want to now engage with us because they see weï¿½re going to be influential in political outcomesJohn Harrison: One of the questions about Family First is, do they have the stamina? To actually do the hard yards in terms of policy? The detailed work that comes with being a member of house of review, which is what the senate is. They need to move very quickly outside their tight Assemblies of God circle and bring others on board the glory trainï¿½         Andrew Bolt:They were lucky to get a person in this time round, and now Liberal and Labor have both got the message, I think youï¿½ll hear a lot more talk on values and morality over the next few years, youï¿½ll hear a lot more politicians, bold enough and brave enough to confess, confess, to being Christians and thatï¿½s got to take some of the support from under them John Cleary: I tend to think, at the moment, that Family First is not going to assume, in Australia, the position that the political Right in the United States have, the religious Right in the United States have, simply because Australians aren't churchgoers and the Australian ethos about religion is, it doesn't like institutional, finger-wagging religion, it doesn't like religion that tells you what you should be doing  Narrator:Back at Paradise church, the candidates and organisers celebrated with more than three thousand Christians from all around the country.In only 12 weeks the Family First Party had been instrumental in influencing the outcome of the federal election. The evangelical Christians had flexed their political muscle and the nation responded.They celebrated their federal crusade raised hands and voices.Ends"

                    "1968: Still Stirred Up ",
                    "I read with interest Paul Hondâ€™s article about Paul Cronin and his documentary A Time to Stir (â€œStir It Up,â€ Spring 2008). Cronin says he would be the last person to claim that he has created a definitive record of Columbia â€™68. He is aware of the endless layers of the story. May I add one more?\n              \n              In January 1967, I left an aircraft carrier cruising off the coast of Vietnam and was discharged from the U.S. Navy. In February, I enrolled at Columbia Business School, where a fair number of recent military veterans were in my class. While at Columbia, I was married at New York City Hall, graduated in June 1968, got a job, and on I went. Obviously, I was there during the Troubles, the Revolution, the Big Change. \n              \n              Hondâ€™s article, while descriptively accurate, barely mentions one of the most important causes of the events of 1968: the draft. Many people forget what a Damocles sword the draft was. I graduated from Bowdoin College in 1963 and applied to Columbia Business School during my senior year. There was no Vietnam War at the time, but the draft was still there. I decided to enlist in the Navy, go to Officer Candidate School, and do my time rather than go to graduate school immediately. Columbia allowed me to enroll after I finished my service.\n              \n              When I finally got to Columbia, the world was changing. The Vietnam War was seen (correctly, in my opinion) as a horrible mistake. Very few men wanted to be drafted.\n              \n              My fellow veterans and I understood this clearly. We empathized. However, we did not believe that the motives \n              of the protesters or activists were primarily altruistic. They said they wanted a better, more democratic, more perfect world. In reality, they didnâ€™t want to take the chance of being killed, which was no less human or understandable than the other motives. \n              \n              Many times we veterans were accosted and disparaged. It really didnâ€™t bother us.\n              \n              Because there is no draft today, the Iraq/Afghanistan war is not analogous to Vietnam. Todayâ€™s soldiers are volunteers. In 1968, at Columbia, almost nobody was.\n              \n                            Robert E. Bachman â€™69BUS\n              Dallas, TX  \n              --\n              ",
                    "In early April 1968, I deposited the required five carbon copies of my PhD dissertation at Low Library. After years of working and reworking my manuscript, I finally had managed to complete it. I wisely kept an extra copy for myself, a precaution that spared me a lot of torment when, a few days later, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) â€œliberatedâ€ and trashed the building. My defense had been scheduled for 10 a.m., May 17. The â€œevents,â€ as we all know, occurred during that time gap.\n              \n              My sympathies were with the student rebels, not for ideological reasons, but because I saw their protest as a carnivalesque spring ritual, part of a global happening. There was, however, no way that anyone could stop me from going through that final initiation rite. My mentor, University Professor Michael Riffaterre â€™55GSAS, was adamant that the University fulfill its responsibilities as usual. So unlike many examinations that were canceled during that period, mine would go on, no matter what.\n              \n              The room that had been assigned for it was, I believe, in Mathematics Hall. When I arrived that morning, barricades and shouting demonstrators blocked the entrance. They were hurling insults at me (â€œFascist pig!â€), and I did feel threatened. One of the Columbia guards led me to the back of the building and helped me get in through a rear window. I found my way to the assigned room, where the five members of the committee were already waiting. The questions and answers began and, under the circumstances, the committee treated me with kid gloves. I would, in fact, have liked it to be more contentious. I was ready to roll.\n              \n              I have often told my own PhD candidates this anecdote as they prepare to face their examiners. They are usually relieved to know that things could be both worse and funnier.\n  \n   Peter W. Nesselroth â€™68GSAS\n  Professor Emeritus\n  University of Toronto\n  Toronto, Ontario\n              --\n              \n            The events of 1968 were precipitated by a single stimulus and no other. This was the withdrawal of draft deferment for college students. Certainly, the peculiarities of Columbia could not explain the similar occurrences at Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale, Michigan, and Stanford (where the ROTC building was torched). The gym? Military research? Nonsense.\n              \n              In all of the reporting concerning the anniversary, I read no significant insight into the precipitating events.\n              \n              Gerald H. Klingon â€™42CC\n              New York, NY\n              --\n              \n              I greatly enjoyed the Spring 2008 editionâ€™s collection of 1968-related pieces, a useful reminder of what the campus was like then and in the years immediately before. Even then, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and other generators of self-righteous revolutionary blather often poisoned discourse that had little to do with their avowed causes, such as ending the Vietnam War, but instead sought opportunities for confrontation with establishment symbols.\n              \n              In the spring of 1966, I came to Columbia to recruit for the Foreign Service, certainly not as a spokesman for the Johnson administration or the Vietnam War. I also went to Syracuse, CCNY, NYU, and Colgate. Only at Columbia was I prevented from speaking, by a noisy group that accused me of being a CIA plant and a bomber of innocent civilians. I left, disappointed but not really surprised. I had met similar groups on campus in 1955â€“56, when I was studying on the Korean War GI Bill. To supplement this rather austere stipend, I had remained a Marine Corps Reserve officer, and occasionally wore a uniform on campus on the way to a Reserve meeting. The catcalls were not as virulent or as loud, but otherwise much the same â€” unpleasant, and not really what Columbia was supposed to be about. Professor Wm. \n              Theodore de Bary had it right in his â€œMy Columbiaâ€ essay.\n              \n               Thomas J. Hirschfeld â€™56GSAS\n            Alexandria, VA\n            --\n            \n            Comments about â€œshattered idealismâ€ do not explain the motivation of the student radicals of 1968. No one to my knowledge has pointed out that these students were children of leftist activists, were subject to a media diet of anti-Americanism, and went to secondary schools that told them they were an elite with the right to boss everyone else around. Conceited, self-appointed dictators, all in a spirit of college fun. \n            \n             Peter Cortland â€™60GSAS \n              Wallingford, CT\n              --\n              \n              Forty years ago we wandered around the campus, wondering what was going to happen next. The students were occupying the buildings; the police were at the gates. We got bored, gave up, went home to bed, and missed getting our heads beaten.\n              \n              What a loss!\n              \n              What a loss for Columbia that it took a decade to build itself back into a citadel of liberal education, free speech, and open inquiry. What a loss for progressive politics that the moral passion and political movement of the â€™60s, particularly the civil rights movement, were hijacked by photo-op activists.\n              \n              By 1967, great strides had been made in opening Columbia as a truly value-neutral community. As an officer of the University Student Council, I was involved in the successful effort to persuade the administration to eliminate class rank from draft-status decisions, thus severing studentsâ€™ academic careers from the needs of the military. I remember the five gay and lesbian students willing to openly declare their sexuality in order for the Student Homophile League to be recognized as the first such student organization in the country. I remember the establishment of a drop-in center on the top floor of Journalism, where students could take some time out from the achievement-only track that had gotten them into Columbia.\n              \n              But, with the hormonal surges of the spring of 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., all of this was obliterated, and almost forgotten, in the adolescent acts of some self-aggrandizing authoritarian anarchists.\n              \n              What a loss!\n              \n               Walter Jonas â€™67GS\n            Milton, MA \n            --\n            \n            Your lively story about Paul Croninâ€™s documentary on Columbia â€™68 took me back 40 years to when two university undergraduates, Steve Weinberg â€™66CC, â€™68GSAPP, â€™90HON and Roger Lehecka â€™67CC, â€™74GSAS (later to be dean of students), talked Columbia College dean David Truman and charismatic history professor Jim Shenton into sponsoring Project Double Discovery on Columbiaâ€™s summer campus in 1965.\n            \n            Double Discovery meant learning about the world outside the run-down neighborhoods of New York Cityâ€™s five boroughs â€” and learning about oneâ€™s self. The Board of Educationâ€™s high-school superintendent, Jack Zack, bought into the program that allowed bright but poor high-school pupils from Harlem and Bed-Sty, for example, to live in the college dormitories each summer, to take a variety of challenging courses taught by the cream of the cityâ€™s faculties, to be counseled by undergraduates, to read widely, and to learn about the cultural life outside their neighborhoods. (One of the counselors for the program was Ted Gold â€™68CC, later to lose his life while preparing a bomb that exploded in a Greenwich Village house.) \n              As a newly appointed high-school principal, I was authorized to develop a curriculum and hire teachers from the five college-bound city programs. Double Discovery was, and remains, an idyllic undertaking that changed the lives for the better of the few hundred youngsters who spent their Julys and Augusts in Butler Library, Ferris Booth Hall, Hamilton Hall, and all over the historic campus.\n              \n              Columbia can truly be proud of its role in inviting those promising teenagers to see another world outside the depressed communities in which many of them lived â€” and to learn about their own potential. \n              \n               Murray Bromberg â€™51GSAS\n            Bellmore, NY\n            --\n            \n            I very much enjoyed reading your Spring issue and the feature on the 1968 movie. In that same issue, Thulani Davis â€™70BC shared an excerpt from a journal she kept during the takeover of Hamilton Hall. Despite the uplifting rhetoric of the time, not all occupiers were considered to be equal by the demonstrators. Davis mentions that the preparation and distribution of food was led by a crew of â€œ10 girlsâ€ and the infirmary was left to another set of â€œ9 to 10 girls.â€ Not to disparage these caretaking responsibilities, but it appears that the more heady, tactical, and policy matters were in the boysâ€™ domain. \n              \n              Let us hope that we have moved beyond these stereotypes, although sometimes one does wonder.\n              \n               Peggy Backman â€™60BC, â€™70TC/GSAS\n              East Hampton, NY \n            --\n            \n            Paul Hondâ€™s review of Paul Croninâ€™s documentary misrepresents the demand that Columbia Students for a Democratic Society actually made between April 1967 and May 1968 regarding Columbia Universityâ€™s institutional membership in the Pentagonâ€™s Institute for Defense Analysesâ€™s (IDA) weapons research think tank, which continues to develop weapons for the Pentagon.\n            \n            Demand 3 of the 1968 Columbia student strike was that â€œthe University sever all ties with the Institute for Defense Analyses and that President Grayson Kirk and Trustee William Burden [â€™26GSAS] resign their positions on the executive committee of that institution immediatelyâ€ â€” not that â€œthe University scrap its IDA contracts,â€ as the review inaccurately states.\n            \n            As Columbia Universityâ€™s institutional representatives on IDAâ€™s executive committee, Kirk and Burden personally â€œapproved all work conducted by IDA, including classified projects directly related to the prosecution of the Vietnam War,â€ according to the Cox Commissionâ€™s â€œCrisis at Columbia: Report of the Fact-Finding Commission Appointed to Investigate the Disturbances at Columbia University in April and May 1968.â€\n            \n            One such secret IDA weapons research project was the automated electronic battlefield development project of IDAâ€™s Jason Division of U.S. university professors, which led to the wounding or killing of between 20,000 to 40,000 Indo-Chinese civilians per year between 1968 and 1973.\n            \n            Interestingly, during this current 21st-century era of â€œpermanent war,â€ Columbia University continues to do contract research work for Pentagon-linked organizations like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Joint Warfare Analysis Center.\n            \n            Bob Feldman â€™69CC\n              Former member \n              Columbia \n              SDS Steering Committee\n            Boston, MA\n            \n            â€œRevolution, Ink.,â€ the discussion in College Walk of two emblematic books that reported the events of spring 1968, omitted a worthy candidate: Dotson Raderâ€™s I Ainâ€™t Marchinâ€™ Anymore!\n              \n              Rader came to the event as a committed radical. He writes with more passion for the cause and less bemusement at finding himself in the thick of things than Jim Kunen. His book has a strong, clear voice, not the somewhat muted resonance of the multiauthored Up Against the Ivy Wall.\n              \n              For this reader at least, Rader presents the most compelling account of both the events and context of those weeks.\n              \n               Charles Saydah â€™67CC\n            Nanuet, NY\n            --\n            \n            The articles and pictures on the student revolution of 1968 brought back vivid memories of this historic and tragic occurrence. I was a student working on my doctorate in library science at the time. I was a resident in one of the womenâ€™s dorms on the campus, and I remember hearing the shouting and uproar in the street outside. When I went out on the roof and looked down on the street, I saw students yelling and carrying on. I wondered if the student revolution in California had spread to New York.\n            \n            It wasnâ€™t long before the revolutionists closed the gates to the campus and would not let anyone other than their group enter. They began invading buildings, faculty offices, and even the quarters of President Grayson Kirk. It kept getting worse by the hour. One faculty member was pulled off the balcony of his building and ended up in the hospital.\n              Somehow, a group of us library science grad students got together and decided we would defend the card catalogue. \n              I could not afford to be barred from the library. I stood at the gate and demanded that they let me in. Somehow, I won my appeal.\n              \n              I received my masterâ€™s degree in library science from Columbia in 1955 and was finally able to get my doctorate in 1975. Columbia will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you so much for your articles. I shall keep this issue of Columbia magazine, which is so special. \n              \n              Jane Ellen Carstens â€™75LS\n            Lafayette, LA\n            --\n            \n            The pieces in the Spring issue on 1968 were interesting but did not depict the range of people involved in the demonstrations, nor the mood and energy on the campus at that time. There are many perspectives and stories around 1968, and not all are represented by the more vocal students, such as Mark Rudd, nor by those who share Wm. Theodore de Baryâ€™s point of view. \n            \n              As a professional staff member in the computing center at that time, I saw many faculty and professionals at campus demonstrations; they were not destructive nor did they prevent anyone from going about their classes or work. Indeed, whether or not one agrees with the movement against the Vietnam War and for civil rights, there is no denying that the energy and desire (even when misplaced) to see changes in our government improves our society. All knowledge is not gained through classrooms or by researchers off in the library stacks; some knowledge comes from action. And there were certainly some positive outcomes at Columbia following the 1968 demonstrations.\n              \n              A small group of professional staff from the main campus and the health/hospital complex came together and established a skills-training program for Harlem residents who were on welfare and unemployed. The program was called Step Forward. We asked individual deans and department heads if we could use equipment and space at night and on the weekends. With the blessing of Acting President Andrew Cordier, we were given an office on 115th Street. \n              \n              Over three years, volunteers taught business and keypunch skills, along with grammar and arithmetic. Two College students from Harlem were part of the group, and they assisted in recruiting. Participants received no stipend, and if they missed more than one session, they were dropped. \n              \n              We trained more than 100 individuals, and while a number found work at Columbia, most were employed by businesses in New York City that contacted Step Forward about employment opportunities. Indeed, we had quite a Rolodex of interested companies to which we could refer individuals. \n              \n              The program ended after three years because it was too difficult for full-time employees with families (I had two young children). But in the time that it operated, the program contributed to a better image for Columbia University in the community. \n              \n              The commitment and effort of Columbia employees to this program was a very positive outcome from 1968. A â€œgood universityâ€ should be about more than its faculty and students, research and learning, and equally about how the university contributes to a better world. The people involved in Step Forward did just that in a small way. They were â€œreal heroesâ€ going beyond what was expected. \n              \n               Sheila D. Creth â€™70GS\n            Chapel Hill, NC \n            --\n            \n            I am the son of David B. Truman, former vice president and provost and professor of public law and government at Columbia. My wife, Tracy, and our daughter, Christine, attended Columbia. \n            \n            I read with interest Paul Hondâ€™s review of the first cut of Paul Croninâ€™s documentary on the Columbia Crisis of 1968. I cooperated with Cronin on this project by sharing with him a copy of my fatherâ€™s Reflections on the Columbia Disorders of 1968. \n            \n            In light of the renewed interest in this period, I want to restate my offer of a few years ago to provide to members of the Columbia community copies of my fatherâ€™s reflections for $20, the cost of reproduction. Requests can be sent to me at 5803 Warwick Place, Chevy Chase, MD 20815.\n              \n              Edwin M.

And of course, I am very pleased that Columbia used some of my photos. My pride was further enhanced by Hondâ€™s reference to my Alma Mater photo in his closing sentences. The cropping of the image was done by me in the viewfinder and thus represents my own, and others,â€™ ambiguous feelings about the meaning of these events, feelings that persist and that Paul Croninâ€™s accomplished film has stirred up and perhaps helped clarify.\n            \n            Nicholas Mirra â€™68CC\n            Brooklyn, NY\n            --",

                    " As a member of the quiet majority, I thank you for Wm. Theodore de Baryâ€™s  â€œMy Columbiaâ€ essay, â€œThe Real Heroes of â€™68.â€ It cleared a politically correct miasma long enveloping Columbia, with its misguided praises of the â€™68 vandals who, in self-righteous arrogance, prevented others from exercising their right to a fine liberal education. Alas, the magazine editors felt compelled to describe de Bary in the table of contents as â€œa liberal professorâ€ rather than an honest seeker of truth. More political correctness?\n              \n              Charles Zimmerman â€™52CC\n              Annapolis, MD\n            --\n            \n            The most recent issue of Columbia magazine is one of the best.\n            \n            I would like to ask de Bary a question. What should the position of the German universities have been had students risen up in protest against Hitlerâ€™s anti-Jewish laws and demanded that the universities take a position against them and shut down faculty groups that supported Hitler? Does he think that this would have unreasonably disallowed a civil discussion about the legitimacy of anti-Semitism?\n            \n            Lionel Trillingâ€™s absolutist description of the function of a university applies to normal times and normal circumstances, but should it apply in extraordinary times, when thousands of Americans were being sent to die in Vietnam for nothing? Should Columbia have been justified in citing academic freedom as a means to hide the fact that the U.S. military was contributing to Columbiaâ€™s budget during the war? Does he think, as well, that there could be reasonable discourse about the blatantly condescending position taken against the black residents of the neighborhood who would have been obliged to enter the gym through a back door? Or should the University have been allowed to permit civil discourse on the merits of segregation and racism?\n              \n              My criticism of the students has to do with their invocation of Mao Zedong, a total monster who brutalized his \n              people and denied them any degree of free discourse.

As a graduate student in 1968, I well remember how we were up against a revolutionary zeal that was not interested in any real dialogue or solution to the problems they themselves caused.\n              \n              I was happy to see de Bary coolly and dispassionately set the record straight. I only hope that we do not relive those days, which made so many of us heartsick. \n              \n              Frank J.

He was not a teacher whom a grad student would call easily by his first name. \n              \n              In his essay on the 1968 uprising, de Bary makes it seem like the quiet majority at the University inwardly wanted to stand up to the militant minority and reclaim their institution of higher learning. My impression was different.\n              It wasnâ€™t until three years later that I interviewed adolescent participants in the Cultural Revolution from schools in China. I found that, like so many of my classmates at Columbia, most of these kids were not swept away or repelled by this movement against authority, but rather, they were ambivalent, having fun with the holiday, or just plain bored.\n              I arrived on campus that day in April having spent the whole night preparing an East Asian Institute thesis presentation. I was pissed that I couldnâ€™t enter the campus from the Amsterdam Avenue side. Someone thrust a leaflet into my hands that diagrammed how to make a Molotov cocktail. An SDSer was bellowing over a megaphone from the bridge way. A whole night wasted.\n              \n              But, my God, what an experience! Charles 37X Kenyatta had come to campus to assess the revolutionary merit of this activity. If Vietnam was to be a key issue, Columbia would have taken the lead. Iâ€™d have time to rework some points in my paper. Little did I know that I also would be able to take a pass in selective classes in accordance with a moratorium.\n              A few years later, when I came back from research in Hong Kong, the campus â€” the East Asian Institute itself â€” was still smoldering with protest against the bombing of Cambodia. A throng of my professors, all of them Professor de Baryâ€™s close associates, had locked arms at the front entrance to the building. Neither inclined to register public protest nor likely to go home, I followed a phalanx of militants inside through the side door. Uttering a â€œLong Live Chairman Mao,â€ (I was dressed in a Mao jacket that I had bought in China), I pressed the elevator button and went back to my cubicle to work. \n              \n              David M. Raddock â€™74GSAS\n            Boulder, CO\n            \n             The writer is the author of Political Behavior of Adolescents in China: The Cultural Revolution in Kwangchow.\n            --\n            \n            As one who participated in the occupation of Low Library and the subsequent strike, I was disappointed and saddened to read â€œThe Real Heroes of â€™68.â€ De Bary remains stubbornly locked into his preconceptions.\n            \n            While Paul Croninâ€™s documentary A Time to Stir seeks to correct the historical distortions wrought by the media and others by highlighting the leading role of the Student Afro-American Society and the black students in Hamilton Hall, de Bary never mentions them. And only briefly does he raise the issue of the gym, which galvanized all of the students and the Harlem community alike.\n            \n              Instead, de Bary regards Mark Rudd as the single mastermind of the revolt in cartoonish distortion of what took place. While Rudd did play an important leading role, de Bary still does not realize how very spontaneous the rebellion was, at least in its initial eruption. To a great degree, Rudd was following the crowd, not leading it. Most of the white students involved in the occupation and strike, including me, were not members of Students for a Democratic Society. We were not manipulated, and if Professor de Bary is angry at what we did, he should spread his rage around to include the thousands of students who were involved and not repeat the media fetishization of Rudd.\n              \n              We believed that both our country and our university were deeply involved in an immoral, genocidal war and in centuries of racial injustice. As said in Paul Croninâ€™s film, most of us felt we were at a moral crossroads and did not want to be Good Germans. In the face of an intractable, mendacious, and autocratic administration, we decided to take a moral stand that did indeed violate the norms. It was an ethical decision, no matter how spontaneous, to remove Grayson Kirkâ€™s files on the Institute for Defense Analyses and publish them in the press, just as it was to tear down the fence around the gymâ€™s construction site when the administration would not listen to the Harlem community, students, Mayor Lindsay, and many others who tried to stop the land grab; and it was an ethical decision to demand amnesty.\n              \n              De Bary chooses to focus on what he considers to be violations of constitutional liberties and of â€œwhat universities were meant to do.â€ I teach at a university today, and I cherish its role to promote civil discussion. I hope that there will be no cause for such a revolt today at any university, even with the immoral war in Iraq. Because of what we did at Columbia, and what students did at San Francisco State, Berkeley, CCNY, and hundreds of other campuses, Columbia and other universities are far better, if still imperfect, places for an open and free exchange of ideas. We responded to what we considered to be egregious violations of human rights at an exceptional moment. Most of us, like everyone else in the West, knew little about Maoâ€™s China. But the slogan that de Bary finds objectionable, â€œTo Rebel Is Justified,â€ we did recognize. They are also words in the spirit of Tom Paine.\n              \n               Hilton Obenzinger â€™69CC \n              Low Library Commune 1968\n              Stanford University\n            Palo Alto, CA\n            \n            Thank you for Wm.

All I wanted to do was finish my course work. I remember trying to get to the library in Schermerhorn one day and a fellow student on a picket line spat on me when I crossed it!\n              \n              I was against the war in Vietnam, and the plan for a gym in Morningside Park did not appeal to me, but the occupation of buildings and the disruption of classes were not the proper way to protest either.\n              \n              I only wish that the police had been called in immediately to remove the original group of people who were trespassing, pure and simple. \n              \n               Mary D. Edwards â€™86GSAS\n              Adjunct Professor, Pratt Institute\n            New York, NY\n            --\n            \n            Wm. Theodore de Baryâ€™s excursion into the origins of the slogan â€œTo Rebel Is Justifiedâ€ is thoroughly irrelevant to the issues of 1968. \n            \n            He also knocks the students for allegedly violating his and othersâ€™ constitutional rights. How about the rights the police violated? Which is more dangerous to peopleâ€™s rights, unarmed students expressing their views or armed police with no ties to the University coming in and brutalizing everyone in sight?\n              \n              When the 1968 affair began on April 23, I was having a leisurely lunch with friends at that most unradical of venues, the Manhattan Playboy Club. However, I lived just off campus on 114th Street at the time, and was working as a journalist. Using my long out-of-date University ID, thumb carefully obscuring the date whenever I had to present it, I entered Math and Fayerweather frequently during the week, and was present when the police assaulted Professor Richard Greeman. I  observed the big bust from Broadway and from Amsterdam, and my report on it was carried in hundreds of papers. \n              On May 17, when students occupied 618 West 114th Street, I tried to talk to the University treasurer, who was observing the proceedings. He publicly insulted me and told me he had no interest in hearing from alumni. For this reason, I do not donate money to Columbia.\n              \n              During the same event, police forced people off the street, then invaded my apartment building, which was not owned by Columbia. They arrested two alumni and two students, charging all four with trespassing. I was one of those four. I have a hard time feeling much sympathy for Professor de Baryâ€™s complaint that students violated his rights. Perhaps he might show a few concerns for the Vietnamese and others killed by the research that IDA sponsored.\n              \n               Thomas Wm.

That day was when the juvenile delinquent Mark Rudd and his gang of Maoist thugs were allowed to shut down the University.\n            \n              What was proved by this regrettable incident? Well, for one thing, that bright, young minds usually are sorely deficient in common sense.\n              \n              Ted de Baryâ€™s article hit the mark. Ted was seen as a â€œcomerâ€ as far back as my freshman year, and time has certainly confirmed the prediction.\n              \n               Edward C. Broge â€™43CC\n              Glen Mills, PA\n            --\n            \n            I want to thank the editors for publishing Columbia magazine. To be honest, it was the first issue of Columbia that I ever read cover to cover.\n            \n            I would like to point out two flaws in Wm. Theodore de Baryâ€™s essay. First, the issue of whether or not Mark Rudd marched under the banner of â€œTo Rebel Is Justified.â€ In the published picture, the banner was carried not by Rudd, but by members of Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF), the youth group of the Workers World Party, a formation of a number of leftist groups that attempted to capture and fit the student uprising to its mold and over which Iâ€™m certain Mark had no control. It is a tribute to the movementâ€™s respect for the First Amendment that anybody could carry any banner they wanted without censorship. \n            \n            As to the origin of the quote from a pro-Stalinist speech of Mao Zedong, I think de Bary may be right that the YAWF, who were Trotskyists, were unaware of this. It doesnâ€™t really matter in the long run, because the banner and the context gave new life to the saying anyway. Second, stating â€œit was others, not Rudd, who suffered the consequences of his violent disruptionsâ€ is wrong. This is an unworthy, below-the-belt remark. Rudd spent seven and a half years as a fugitive underground. I think that was suffering enough.\n            \n            I disagree with de Baryâ€™s other points, but the presence of his essay in this issue helps to re-create a sense of what the struggle was up against: lies and half-truths used as justifications of passivity and mediocrity.\n              \n              Rudd emerged as a leader and helped kick off the movement that eventually ended the war and sowed the seeds of all future peace protests. I never knew him, but I was affected by his life and thank him for his influence. \n              \n               Matilda Williams â€™91PH\n            Seminole, OK\n            --\n            \n            I read with great interest â€œThe Real Heroes of â€™68.â€ It captured my sentiments precisely. At the time, I was president of Columbia College Alumni Association and obviously interfaced with many alumni. As you can imagine, with any group from Columbia College, a variety of views were expressed. A clear majority were, and I believe are, in de Baryâ€™s camp. \n            Thanks for taking the time to deliver this much-needed essay on the events of â€™68.\n            \n            Henry King â€™48CC\n            Board of Trustees Chairman Emeritus  New York, NY\n            --\n            \n            Congratulations to Professor Emeritus Wm. Theodore de Bary for his courageous, thoughtful, and convincing account. The heroes were certainly not that minority of zealots who exploited the openness of the most distinguished institutions of a society based on the rule of law to disrupt orderly procedures and who tried with too much success to render them futile. I recall from across the interval of nearly six decades the brilliant lectures of de Bary on China, Japan, and Korea, as well as those of David Truman on the American constitutional order. I fully agree with de Bary that his view reflects the opinion of a quiet majority among those concerned about the days that shook Morningside.\n            \n            I did not witness these days at Columbia. From 1967 until mid-1969, I was in Prague, Czechoslovakia, watching unarmed citizens â€” including many youth who could justly be described as heroic â€” champion the liberalizing spirit of the Prague Spring and then resist, sometimes at the cost of their lives and far more often at the cost of their freedom, the imposition of a new dictatorship borne on the treads of Soviet tanks. These persons were defending an order striving to expand freedom where it had not existed and would not exist again. What a contrast between the â€œstrikeâ€ of Mark Rudd against higher education in New York and the self-immolation of Jan Palach, a student of about the same age in Prague. When it came in August 1968, the â€œbustâ€ there would silence dissent and forestall democracy in Czechoslovakia for more than 20 years.\n            \n             Kenneth N.

Theodore de Baryâ€™s perspective from the other side. That other side, known as the Majority Coalition, comprised 2000 of Columbia Collegeâ€™s then 2700 students who signed statements opposing the building takeovers and mustered enough members to completely surround and block access to the occupied buildings 24 hours a day continuously. Unlike the protesters, they did not resort to force or violence to make their mark on history. But that is no reason to minimize their place. \n            \n             Tao Tan â€™07CC\n            Sydney, Australia\n            \n            I found Wm. Theodore de Baryâ€™s criticism of the SDS engaging in many ways, but also slightly misleading. The primary thrust of his criticism was the way that the activities of the SDS infringed on the â€œcivil libertiesâ€ and â€œdue processâ€ of those who didnâ€™t agree with them, â€œespecially the right of freedom of assembly (guaranteed by the Bill of Rights).â€ Of course, the Bill of Rights only protects individuals against infringement of these rights by the government. The SDS was the furthest thing from that. While we like to think that the rights enshrined in the Constitution against government intrusion are universal and inviolable (at least in this country), when it comes to private interactions, these rights are sacrificed every time someone interrupts you while speaking or a security guard on campus asks you to keep College Walk clear. Entering a private domain like the Columbia campus involves an agreement to curtail oneâ€™s exercise of some of those rights protected from government intrusion and to abide by a different set of rules. Naturally, SDS wasnâ€™t abiding by those rules at the time. But if the Columbia administration chose not to enforce those rules at that moment, one who was aggrieved by that choice wouldnâ€™t get far by pointing to the Bill of Rights. More broadly, if de Bary has a valid moral criticism of the tactics employed by SDS in â€™68, it only confuses the issue and detracts from his argument by couching it inside a legal framework (especially one so unlikely to achieve any redress if pursued in court in these terms).\n            \n             Kenneth Ehrenbergâ€™93CC,â€™05GSAS\n              Assistant Professor of Philosophy\n              Research Associate Professor of Law\n            University at Buffalo, SUNY",

The story is a great accomplishment in that it creatively explores both the wealth of issues raised by the events of 1968 and their importance for today. It stands out among all the media coverage of Columbia; Hond and Columbia magazine should be proud of this accomplishment. \n              \n              However, there is one critical point I would like to raise. While Hond quite accurately recounts the views of Hamilton Hall participants that the black role in the Columbia revolt has been obscured by focus on the white students, he recapitulates the same mistake by omitting any reference to the fact that there actually exists a film produced by a black student participant, Sherry Suttles â€™69BC.

                    "Talking Tibet ",
                    "In â€œTibetâ€™s Long Shadowâ€ (Spring 2008), Professor Andrew James Nathan, in his otherwise often insightful commentary, says that â€œthe Chinese government asserts, correctly, that it has internationally recognized control over Tibet, that Tibet is part of Chinese territory, and that Tibet belongs to China.â€ This statement would be correct if he took out the word correctly. It is true that all countries recognize Chinaâ€™s control of Tibet. But Tibet is not â€œpart ofâ€ China nor does it â€œbelong toâ€ China. Every international legal scholar, without exception, who has objectively analyzed Tibetâ€™s historical and legal status has concluded (as has Congress, repeatedly, despite the official policy of the U.S. executive branch) that â€œTibet is an occupied sovereign country under international law.â€ Tibet possessed all of the features of an independent sovereign state under international law between at least 1913 and 1949. Historically, it vacillated between periods of independence and greater or lesser degrees of military control by foreign dynasties â€” principally those of the Manchus and the Mongols â€” as, incidentally, did China itself. In 1949, Mao Zedongâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army invaded and occupied Tibet. Subsequently, officials of the Dalai Lamaâ€™s government, acting without authorization and under duress that included both threats of brutal violence against the Tibetan people and personal physical violence against the officials themselves, signed the 17-Point Agreement, which purports to reunite Tibet with the â€œMotherland â€” the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.â€ \n              \n              By 1949, however, international law had ceased to regard military occupation as a valid way for states to acquire territory. And treaties signed under personal duress or because of threats made in violation of the United Nations Charterâ€™s prohibition on the threat or use of force are void ab initio. (It is also revealing to note that China felt the need to enter into a treaty with an entity that it claims was never an independent state with the capacity to enter into treaties.) Tibet is no more a â€œpart ofâ€ China than East Timor had been a â€œpart ofâ€ Indonesia after the late President Suharto invaded and purported to annex it in 1976. Yes, China maintains de facto control over Tibet; to recognize that may be realpolitik. But let us at least have the moral courage to speak the truth and not to perpetuate the legal and historical fiction that Tibet is â€œpart ofâ€ or â€œbelongs toâ€ China. On this issue, I wrote in another context that â€œ[f]or as long as the international community continues to indulge the fiction that Tibet is â€˜part ofâ€™ China, Chinaâ€™s political elite will continue to claim â€˜interference in internal affairsâ€™ as a shield to fend off criticism of its alleged â€˜ownershipâ€™ of Tibet and scrutiny of its human rights abuses against the Tibetan people. To challenge this fiction will not by itself restore Tibetâ€™s sovereignty. But it will prevent the issue of Tibetâ€™s status from vanishing behind the veneer of legitimacy generated by years of CCP propaganda and international acquiescence. It may therefore prove the first step â€” and an essential predicate â€” toward vindicating the Tibetan peopleâ€™s right to self-determination.â€\n              \n              Tibet is, legally, a colony â€” every bit as much, and in precisely the same sense, as the former colonies of Europe that gained their independence after World War II. And the Tibetan people, like every other colonized people, enjoy the right under international law to self-determination, that is, to â€œfreely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.â€\n              \n               Robert D.

I suggest that Andrew James Nathan, Robert Barnett, and Robert Thurman do some preliminary reading on Chinese and Tibetan history with an open mind.\n            \n            Columbia, being the â€œmagazine of Columbia University,â€ should report on Columbia: current news, features on students and faculty past and present, etc. This is not Time or Newsweek.

Craigâ€™s article on digitization  and libraries in the Spring issue.\n              \n              Your readers might be interested to know that there are two Web sites that try to keep track of books, documents, and periodicals that have been digitized. The Web sites are Online Books Page and Digital Book Index. Depending on the site, you can look up an item by author, title, subject, or key word to find its location. Itâ€™s a good idea to check both sites when searching for a particular item.

As indicated in my book, Underwriting the Internet: How Technical Advances, Financial Engineering, and Entrepreneurial Genius Are Building the Information Highway, both search providers have the financial and technical resources to scan the stacks, rank each volume according to user popularity, and place ads next to search results.\n            \n            Technical treatises, like my masterâ€™s and doctoral dissertations, will, in all likelihood, be at the bottom of such popularity and advertisersâ€™ lists unless they become commercially valuable due to their increased visibility on online databases. Income will then accrue to the search providers unless Columbia has an arrangement with Google like Stanford does. That California university received a stock grant from founders of the company that is now worth over $900 million and sold a part of it (184,207 shares) for $15.7 million when Google went public in August 2004. It also holds the rights to some of Googleâ€™s key patents, for which it received $625,000 in 2007.\n            \n            Letâ€™s hope Columbia will similarly benefit from its new relationship with the search companies that provide needed funds for enlarging, cataloguing, and maintaining its libraryâ€™s scholarly collection.

                    "Â Â Â  The classic debate between collectivism and individualism is apparent in practically every social movement, so it is not surprising to see this debate arise within the LGBT movement. Though all the members of the LGBT movement initially worked for the same set of general goals, two distinct groups formed as a result of conflicting ideals: queer theorists, whose \"loud and proud\" discourse emphasized the differences between the LGBT community and mainstream \"heterosexual\" society, and societal conformists, who focussed their efforts on the acceptance and equality of the LGBT community in respect to society at large.Â  Over time, the dynamics of these two groups changed--lesbians fragmented into their own group, transsexuals were forced into their own communities, and radical activists left their more conservative counterparts behind. However, despite the formation of various agendas within the LGBT movement, there is still a cohesiveness that unites all of these various subgroups when common goals need to be achieved. Thus, there is ultimately a need for both collectivism and individualism within the LGBT movement; individuals get the support they need from their \"sub-communities\" and exclusive groups, while the LGBT community as a whole serves to advance the rights and acceptance of gay, lesbian and other \"queer\" groups in our hetero-normal world.",
                    "Â Â Â  Though homophile groups such as the Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society are often accredited with pushing homosexual rights out into the open, the role of college students in the expansion of the LGBT movement has long been overlooked. In his essay, Brett Beemyn profiles student activism for gay rights and traces the impact that such activism had on the future of the gay liberation movement as a whole. He begins by discussing the formation of student organizations in the late 1960s and early 1970s, especially Cornell University's Student Homophile League (SHL), that began to be open about homosexuality. Not only did the SHL promote being forthright about sexual orientation, but it encouraged its gay members to be proud of who they were. Oftentimes, for instance, the SHL would host \"zaps\", or discussions in which homosexuals would share their own experiences and learn from one another so as to create an environment uninhibited by social norms, fears and prejudices.\nÂ Â  Â Despite their emphasis on the concept of being gay, the SHL managed to attract a number of non-gay supporters. The SHL's participation in other on-campus activist movements caused many heterosexual activists to realize how important an issue gay rights was. Interestingly enough, the majority of the SHL, at its onset, was heterosexual. These straight members, who formed a substantial portion of the SHL, served a dual purpose; they provided some protection for the SHL's gay members, who were often persecuted, and attracted other non gay activists to the movement, thereby providing strength in numbers. In addition to the advantages given by heterosexual members, the SHL also made it a policy to not require members to identify themselves with their sexual orientations. Thus, the SHL quite successfully used the collectivist approach to spread the concept of homosexuality.\nÂ Â  Â As time went on, however, the SHL began to depart from its more inclusive standpoint and encountered a split between radical activists and those who wished to downplay being gay in order to avoid a great deal of publicity. Despite these emerging differences and the subsequent division of objectives, it is important to remember that student activism's collective approach was, in the end, responsible for helping bring the issue of being gay out into the open.",
                    "Â Â Â  In terms of identity politics, the gay and lesbian movement was quite divided. Some wanted to stress the similarities between homosexuals and heterosexuals, and thus attempt to assimilate into mainstream society. On the other hand, many activists were fed up with the heteronormal world and wished to break stiff social roles that had been forced upon them. They wished to redefine themselves as separate from the society that threatened to constrain them in every which way possible. Despite these opposing agendas, however, activists of both minds were able to achieve some key goals through the use of collectivism. In her essay, Mary Bernstein discusses this collectivist aspect of the gay and lesbian movement and addresses the gains begotten by such an approach. She especially highlights the homophile movement and groups such as the Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society as organizations that helped unify all of the divisions within the gay and lesbian movement so as to achieve a set of goals that would allow all divisions to pursue their respective agendas. Homophile groups mainly spearheaded efforts to educate health professionals, as well as other high-ranking officials, in order to reduce the stigma placed on being homosexual. As a result, these professionals would use their sway to change legislation, such as sodomy laws, to better benefit the gay community. Subsequently, a gradual social acceptance of homosexuality came into effect, and lesbians and gay men were more able to emerge from the closeted homophile movements and campaign more openly for their rights.\nÂ Â Â  Even though gay activists had a number of varying, and often conflicting, agendas, collectivism nevertheless proved to be vital to the survival of each sub-movement, and the gay movement as a whole. Without the gains provided by the concentrated effort to educate others about homosexuality, society would not have been as receptive as they proved to be.",
                    "Â Â Â  In his chapter entitled \"The Gay Liberation Movement,\" John D'Emilo describes this movement as influencing both individuals and the political structure. D'Emilio begins his discussion of the gay movement by introducing the Stonewall Riot, remembered for being the first gay riot in history. Not only did it have an enormous impact at the time, but it motivated further radical activism. After the riot had ended, a new form of politics characterized the gay liberation movement--a confrontational politics that required its participants to openly express their dissatisfaction with the current government and its oppression of homosexuals. With this new form of social action numerous riots erupted, some of which drew blood. The violence of this radical method put a spotlight on the gay liberation movement and gave it nation-wide publicity. People all over the country were faced with the growing issue of homosexuality.\nÂ Â Â  In addition to the attention that the movement received, the new movement also attracted many new members. These new members were drawn to the group not only because of common sexual identity, but also because they shared a common political perspective. A vast majority of the new members were young radicals that believed in bravely boasting their homosexuality for the world to see in order to force the issue of homosexuality on the American public. With this ideal \"coming out\" and stating one's homosexuality became both personal and political because it helped to build a foundation for the gay liberation movement. Homosexuality was no longer something to be hidden from the world out of fear. Instead, with the title of being gay or lesbian the individuals knew that they were part of an organization that supported its members for who they were.\nÂ Â Â  Due to the fact that the American public met homosexuality with strong opposition, gays and lesbians formed tightly knit organizations and circles for support. This created an undoubtedly strong sense of community and brotherhood among its members because they all shared common ideals and experienced the same resentment. Through all of this the gay liberation movement adopted a separatist ideology. Even though they were recruiting thousands of new members, the gay liberation community was solely comprised of homosexuals because they were the ones that shared the common desire for eliminating the oppression of gays and enlisting equal rights.",
                    "Â Â Â  \"The Gay and Lesbian Movement\" briefly describes the evolution of the homosexual identity. Gays and lesbians have always had to fight against discrimination and prejudice. With the American society uniting against the gays and lesbians a strong sense of union developed among homosexuals. These homosexuals united around the idea that homosexuality was a large part of political and personal identity. During the twentieth century, society placed strict regulations that pressured people to stay within society's norms. Homosexuality was met with resentment and was even labeled a mental illness because it deviated from the social norm of heterosexuality. The prejudices that lesbians and gays faced caused them to form groups that focused on political and social goals as an effort to gain equal stance in society.\nÂ Â Â  As time passed, a new generation of homosexuals emerged. This generation held very radical views and possessed an open sense of pride about being homosexual. The new radical theme of the gay liberation movement forced people in American society to acknowledge homosexuality and the lack of equal rights for gays and lesbians as a prominent issue. As the quest for equal rights continued, a sense of identity began to develop among the gays and lesbians. This sense of identity based itself off of the desire for equal rights and a sense of commonality. In addition to this, the idea of a gay community emerged as a very important aspect in defining one's identity because it served as a support group both emotionally and physically.\nÂ Â Â  However, while the presence of a community emerged, the gay liberation transformed into a separatist movement. The gay community centered itself around issues involving the liberation of homosexuals, with their key focus being eliminating oppression and prejudice. The members of this group united to stand against society. By doing this they segregated themselves and their cause. This made it increasingly difficult to gain universal acceptance, which is something that they desperately needed. Nevertheless, the organization and its radical members continued to believe that they had to stand against all of society, rather than trying to incorporate themselves into it.",
                    "Â Â Â  Identity politics surrounded the LGBT movement. The clashing outlooks on the Queer Theory and the role of transgender and bisexuals were prevalent and it was a constant battle. This, however, was perfectly understandable. While looking at the values of each of the two opposing groups within the LGBT movement, it is apparent that their principles and goals were not the same. This is a classic debate between assimilationists and separatists. Joshua Gamson highlights the differences between the two different groups and the arguments they shared through the use of San Francisco's lesbian and gay newspapers. Whereas queer deconstructs collective categories, the collective group builds the categories up. It supports them and gives the LGBT movement a public collective identity. Collectivists assert that the gays and lesbians share a minority status: the shared oppression that is the denial of the freedom and opportunity to possess the natural same-sex desires. They believe that this clear identity enables them to successfully resist this oppression and make political gain.\nÂ Â Â  Despite the large emphasis the article places on Queer Theory, Gamson includes a great deal of information concerning the older generation of gays and lesbians. The generational gap provides the main argument over the word \"queer\" and basically the distinction between the two groups pushing for equal rights in the LGBT movement; the older group generally making up the assimilationists (emphasizing sameness) and the younger generation emphasizing differences and separation. This ideology just does not mesh with the older generation. Primarily, they tend to believe that, to gain the rights they desire, they need to prove that they are just like everyone else. They are normal and they are everywhere and every type of person. These homosexuals are, in every way, similar to heterosexuals and, therefore, deserve the same rights. Secondly, most of the older generation cannot reclaim the word \"queer\" as the younger generation does. It is derogatory and is associated with very bad memories and crimes. These two disparities make up the major controversies between the groups. Whereas Queer Theory wants to be different and be proud of it, the collective group believes that to further their position in society, it is more effective to be the same and to not shout out the differences that not all gays and lesbians possess. This article is important in contrasting assimilation and separatist ideologies. Gamson expresses both sides very well and shows that both is a useful political tactic.",
                    "Â Â Â  Queer Theory is a radical form of \"deconstructionism.\" In this journal, Green draws upon two different strains of Queer Theory to illustrate the shortcomings in the radical approach used by the modern queer theorists. Though queer has been praised for its innovative, in-your-face defiant attitude, according to Green, \"... queer theory tends to lapse into a discursively burdened, textual idealism that glosses over the institutional character of sexual identity and the shared roles that sexual actors occupy\" (522). Green touches upon the inadequacies present in the theory by identifying two strains and applying them to specific historical cases of homosexuality. He identifies two different strains: \"radical deconstructionism\" and \"radical subversion.\" The former is said to gloss over the institutional organization of sexuality by rejecting the classifications gay and straight and thereby making the sexological classifications incomprehensible. Or, in slightly more explicable terms, Green points out that queer theorists tend to underestimate the differences between gay and straight. Yet, secondly, the queer theorists also neglect social roles that both straight and gays possess therefore overestimating straight and gay difference. Though this may sound contradictory, Green logically explains the two largest deficiencies in the Queer Theory through his use of historical context.\nÂ Â Â  By analyzing the Queer Theory, Green assists in comparing and contrasting this group and the less modern use of sociology within the LGBT movement. The article can help dissect the Queer Theory's overeager outlook on the gay and lesbian movements and studies. Though eager to be seen as different but still good, they ignore similarities with heterosexuals that the collective group tried to emphasize. And conversely, though obsessed with being different, they are also trying to get exactly the same treatment as heterosexuals, thereby ignoring any of their differences which the original collective group recognizes: they are the same, except for their sexual orientation.",
                    "Â Â Â  In this paper, Adam Isaiah Green relates Queer Theory, Foucaldian approaches, and sociology. Everything is related and tied together in very technical and well thought out terms. It shows, in logical procession, that both Queer Theory and sociology in gender issues were involved in the deconstruction of sexual orientation. Green discusses numerous ideas from the work of Foucault, an authority on the subject of sexuality and gender studies, and contrasts them with Queer Theory. Though Green notes that to some the old school sociology may seem hopelessly outdated, he points out that Queer Theory and the older ideas of sociology are like \"siblings, with roots in a parallel deconstructionist conception of identity\" (30).\nÂ Â Â  Though there may be many small differences, looking at the big picture, one can see that Queer Theory and the older sociological ideas all stem from the same collective ideas and groups. The LGBT movement, as a whole, is a collective group with very similar ideas to deconstruct the hetero-normal sexual orientation. This article is important in showing that, though the Queer Theory and the more conventional sociology are very different, they encompass the same general ideas and goals.",
                    "Â Â Â  Thus far, most documented use of collectivism in the LGBT movement has been prevalent during the beginnings of the movement. As a result of the varying notions of homosexual identity, however, the LGBT movement eventually fragmented into a number of subgroups, each with its own agenda and set of ideals. Despite such dominance of individualism within the gay movement, the LGBT movement has retained the ability to unite whenever the homosexual, bisexual and transgender community has faced threats as a whole. In her essay, Valerie Jenness discusses one such instance in the 1980s and 1990s, in which waves of hate crime-related violence affected many homosexuals. As a result, the various LGBT organizations pooled to form region-specific groups with the sole intent of reducing violence against their community. Though these groups later decided to find and fight against other definitions of \"anti gay and lesbian violence\", such as domestic violence, the initial action of LGBT activists cannot be overlooked. Such a response to the violence that surrounded them is strongly indicative of the underlying collectivist sentiment that functions, in times of need, to achieve goals that would benefit the LGBT community as a whole. Thus, collectivism allows for a loose association, at least, of the LGBT movement 's subgroups.",
                    "Â Â Â  Katherine Johnson's article provides a rather interesting look into the identities of transsexual individuals.Â  Within the gay and lesbian movement, Johnson points out that tension and rejection exists between groups, specifically against transsexuals.Â  Johnson carefully examines the hostility towards both male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals, and analyzes the similarities and differences between the reactions of the lesbian and gay community at large to these two individual groups.\nÂ Â Â  Johnson notes that male-to-female transsexuals often face harsh criticism from both feminists and lesbians.Â  These transsexuals are often described as \"deviant males\", because as far as the lesbians are concerned, although these individuals associate themselves with the female gender and have undergone a sex change operation, they will never truly know what it's like to be a \"woman\".Â  Many male-to-female transsexuals often describe their orientation as being lesbian--originally attracted to women when they were \"men\", these women are still attracted to other women.Â Â  One possible suggestion Johnson makes to account for this hostility is that feminists and lesbians may feel that because male-to-female transsexuals were raised as men in a patriarchal society, their behavior as women reflect a stereotype, which may not necessarily reflect the femininity of biological females.\nÂ Â Â  Similarly, Johnson also points out that female-to-male transsexuals also face criticism from the gay and lesbian community.Â  Many who argue against these individuals claim that they are simply \"butch lesbians who change sex to justify same-sex relationships or to avoid harassment\". Due to the fact that many female-to-male transsexuals categorized themselves as lesbians before their sex change, and are still attracted to women after they become men, feminist and lesbian opponents of this practice may refer to the female-to-male change as the \"destruction of lesbians\" because according to the definitions of gender, these transsexuals are now \"straight\".Â  However, many of these men do not refer to themselves as straight.Â  Rather, they refer to themselves as being \"queer\", with their masculinity taking on the characteristics of \"a different kind of man\".\nÂ Â Â  Overall, Johnson points out that there is a very prevalent hostility towards transsexuals in the gay and lesbian movement and community.Â  Although they all fall under the umbrella term \"queer\", transsexual groups often differentiate themselves from the \"traditional\" gender defined categories of gay and lesbian, having their own unique issues regarding their gender and subsequent sexual orientation.",
                    "Â Â Â  The article \"Urvahi Vaid Speaks on Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights\" describes a speech that was given by Vaid, an author, lawyer, and former director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.  Vaid believed that homosexuality was not fully accepted by heterosexual society.  This presented an obstacle that prevented the movement for gay and lesbian rights from moving forward.  Vaid analyzed the gay liberation movement as being too separatist.  She felt that in order for the movement to be successful it would eventually have to branch out with its ideals and include other movements seeking equality, such as gender or class.  By doing this, Vaid believed that the gay liberation movement would increase its impact on the American political structure by encompassing a larger percentage of the American population.\nÂ Â Â  In terms of having a large affect on the political and legislative aspects of society, Vaid felt that the gay and lesbian movement also needed the participation of  gay and lesbian voters who were not voting and participating in changing the legislative structure.  The addition of these voters would increase the power of the movement by increasing the number of participants.  All in all, the overall theme that Vaid stressed was the importance of power by numbers.  This is a very important aspect to take into consideration in order for a social movement to be successful.  There must be a substantial amount of people that are demanding change in society's structure.\nÂ Â Â  The outright radicalism of the liberation movement did more to separate the liberation movement than it did to assimilate it into American society at times.  Exclusive communities formed among the gays and lesbians that built themselves off of sharing a common sexuality.  By basing the group off of this theme it separated itself from the heterosexual society.  This division created many problems for the gay and lesbian movement because as it fought to be considered equal, it also fought to be recognized as different.",
                    "Â Â Â  Kenneth Plummer's paper focuses on a few topics, including the \"nature of the 'homosexual' category\" and deconstruction of identity within the gay and lesbian movement.Â  Plummer states that there is an inherent problem in the labeling of homosexuals within the gay and lesbian movement, as well as in research studies, because the terms and categories used to describe the group at large are ever changing and the definitions of categories may differ from group to group, location to location, generation to generation, etc.\nÂ Â Â  Plummer argues that because the once accepted notion that homosexuality was a psychological condition was rejected, individuals were no longer placed in homosexual categories by medical \"experts\".Â  Rather, the individual must place him or herself into a distinct category based on his or her perceived sexual orientation.Â  Plummer suggests that this self-labeling of one's gay identity is \"increasingly pivotal to their personal world...creating a proliferation of separatist groups, until both mentally and spatially 'the homosexual' exists as a highly restricted and confined species\".\nÂ Â Â  Other key points that Plummer brings to light are the ramifications of self categorization and the deconstruction of homosexual categories.Â  Because, as Plummer argues, \"homosexuality is a complex, diffuse experience that anyone may have\", any individual may place him/herself into a homosexual category.Â However, these very categories pose a problem because they can be de-constructed and can evolve over time.Â  They are not static definitions, but rather part of the homosexual dynamic of identity.Â  Plummer references the work of a researcher named Kinsley, who found that some men will have homosexual experiences of varying in degrees between the ages of 13 and 55, and some will actually change how they identify themselves over this time.\nÂ Â Â  Plummer provides an explanation for this dynamic, once again returning to the concept of \"medicalization\".Â  The once defined homosexual categories imposed by \"experts\" in the field placed individuals in specific groups according to a static rubric for diagnoses.Â However, as this practice of \"medicalization\" became less accepted by society and the homosexual community, the labeling of homosexuality of an individual became the decision of the individual.Â  As Plummer argues, it is the deconstruction of homosexual categories through individual identity choices that leads to a more dynamic interpretation of sexual orientation.",
                    "Â Â Â  In her paper, Barbara Ponse argues that lesbian identity and its separation from the other categories of identity in the gay and lesbian movement stem from its social construction within the gay subculture.Â  Ponse begins by discussing how the terms \"gay, female homosexual, lesbian, and bisexual\" are used as labels for an individual's identity within the lesbian subculture, and may be used describe various characteristics of the individual, including her \"chronological age, her age of entry into the community, the historical time in which she enters the lesbian life, the extent of integration into the community,...as well as the private sector of the community with which she is affiliated\".Â  These categories are also used to describe an individual's orientation after she has discovered it. Â Â   Â Â \nÂ Â Â  Ponse explains that each term used to describe lesbian identity is a description of a lifestyle as a whole.Â  In the case of the term \"lesbian\", this word is used to describe a woman who is attracted to other women, and its usage came about as a political statement, used to separate females who were exclusively homosexual from the gay community at large.Â  Ponse makes note of the fact that although the original definition of \"lesbian\" still applies, it has, in some communities and groups, been expanded as an umbrella category for homosexual feminists and women who are questioning their orientation as bisexuals.Â  The term \"lesbian\" arguably has a political usage, involving the \"destigmatization and demystification\" of the lifestyle, and may be used to raise consciousness amongst those without much knowledge of the word's meaning. Â Â \nÂ Â Â  The key argument made by Ponse is that the lesbian community separates itself from the general LGBT community because of the individual's need to identify herself.Â  Lesbians are different from heterosexuals in that they are attracted to members of the same sex.Â  They are also different from the gay community, which Ponse defines specifically in this case as the gay male community, because lesbians are women attracted to women.Â  Ponse suggests that the need for an individual's own community and sense of belonging within a community contributed to the uprising of individual groups, such as the lesbians, within the gay and lesbian movement.Â  Ponse ultimately argues that the gay and lesbian movement as a whole did not provide a sufficient support network for individuals who categorized themselves into specific sexual orientations, and that the separation of the lesbian movement was a result of the social construction of the general \"gay\" movement."

                    "Reviewed by Gary MillerThere are two major flaws regarding Rodger McDanielâ€™s new book, Dying for Joe McCarthyâ€™s Sins: The Suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester Hunt. The first negative is no fault of the author. In fact, the author even admits to the absence of some factual information that is not available. Some of the records of Sen. Joe McCarthy are still not available to the public, and some records were destroyed by the FBI (J Edgard Hoover or his staff?) This presented a problem to the author of not being able to tell the entire story.",
                    "The second is that there wasnâ€™t much discussion of how Senator Hunt and his wife reacted when their son was arrested for soliciting sex with another male. The author does mention the parents were at the trial and that it was a strain on the family (to the point it caused Sen. Huntâ€™s suicide), but I wanted more. This was in the 50s. How would parents react when they found out their son had been arrested for this kind of â€œcrimeâ€?However the positives of the book outweigh the negatives.The story in the book has needed to be told for several years for many reasons. One is to show the lack of civility in Congress both then and now. I was asked recently why â€œdirty politicsâ€ works. The author gives a good answer: because â€œa lazy, ill informed electorate is willing to abdicate its responsibility to the agenda of others.â€ Some interesting tidbits from the book:In 1910 in a town in Illinois, it was against the law to give a political speech on Sunday. A particular candidate came to town, didnâ€™t know about the law, and began to speak. The police informed him of the law. The candidate simply told the police officer he was not giving a campaign speech but was actually giving a sermon. The candidate took advantage of the situation by passing a collection plate.In the 1920s in Lander, Wyoming, the city was so flush with money they gave teachers at 35% increase to $125 a month.When Truman was sworn into office of the presidency, it was the first time in history where a president was sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Senator HuntSenator Lester Hunt started out his political career by serving on the Lander school board in Wyoming, served as president of the local Chamber of Commerce and also president of the local chapter of the Kiwanis. Dentist by profession, he also became president of the Wyoming Board of Dental Examiners and the Wyoming Dental Association. From there, he served in the state legislature before serving as their governor.Democratic Governor Lester Hunt decided to run for Senate against a Republican incumbent in a Republican state in 1948. The head of the ticket was Harry S Truman, whom no one thought could win the presidency. Truman took his whistle stop tour to Wyoming to help candidate Hunt. Both Truman and Hunt won Wyoming. Until the 1948 election, Republicans had been in control of both houses of Congress. That election changed and gave the Senate to the Democrats. Truman won campaigning against the â€œno nothing Congressâ€. Where is Truman now that we need him?VaticanBook goes into more Wyoming history and legislative history of Sen. Hunt than most of us would be interested in and many would skip over. However some issues would be interesting even outside of Wyoming such as the efforts of President Truman, who for the first time, wanted to appoint an ambassador to the Vatican. Today, we accept the fact we have an ambassador to the Vatican, but Sen. Hunt received no letters in support of the presidentâ€™s proposal.Health careTruman was not the first president to talk about national health care, but he did say health care was a national security issue. Even in the late 40â€™s, the US was one of the last countries to provide health care to its citizens. Trumanâ€™s biggest argument for national health care was he felt there was a lack of qualified (i.e. healthy) men to volunteer for the military. He indicated five million men were found unqualified during WWII because of some kind of health issue. Another million and half had to be discharged from the military because of health issues.Sen Hunt agreed with Truman in theory that national health care was needed, but didnâ€™t agree with the specifics of the presidentâ€™s plan (sound familiar?). In the words of the author, those in opposition â€œcould not keep a finger in the dike foreverâ€.Other â€œsocialistâ€ programsHunt made a list of government programs at one time considered socialist by conservatives:Public school systemWomenâ€™s suffrageIncome taxInterstate Commerce CommissionEight-hour work dayWorkerâ€™s compensationPure Food and Drug ActFederal Reserve ActMinimum WageGuarantee of bank depositsChild labor lawsSecurities and Exchange ActFederal aid to highwaysRural Electrification AdministrationSoil Conservation ServiceI am sure you and I could name more such as health care for all, Medicare, civil rights.Lavender menaceDuring this time period (late 40s early 50s), there was actually a serious proposal to keep information on â€œhomosexuals and perverts of all typesâ€. There was a congressional committee called â€œSubcommittee to Investigate the Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Governmentâ€. Bureau heads were required to attend seminars on â€œPerversion among government workersâ€. The State Department released their \u2028â€œProblem of Homosexuals and Sex Perverts in the Department of Stateâ€. Department of State informed Congress â€œmoral degenerates are fleeing the State Department at the rate of one or two each weekâ€. It is estimated 10,000 individuals lost their jobs because of this witch-hunt against gays.President Eisenhower signed an Executive Order having to do with security clearances for government employment, which specifically listed â€œsexual perversionâ€ as a condition for firing federal employees. (I wonder if there were any a place which gave a definition of â€œperversionâ€).Lafayette ParkMany gay men all over the country are aware of Lafayette Park in Washington DC as a place to meet other gays. Gay men also know this has been a placed where one could get mugged for simply for being a â€œfaggotâ€ and also known as a place for police entrapment. Most men, who have gone or go to Lafayette Park looking for sex, are usually married heterosexual men looking for certain kinds of sexual activity that they are not able to receive at home.This has been the case for decades. According to the author, even as far back as the 1890s, Lafayette Park was the destination point of an annual event where hundreds of gay African American men dressed in drag.Lester Hunt Jr.So many men were arrested during that time period, Lester Hunt Jr, was one of them. Lester Hunt Jr attended the Quaker school Swarthmore College. He graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in history. After he graduated, he accepted a teaching job in Mexico City and in Cuba. He decided to go into the ministry and enrolled at the Episcopal Theological School at Cambridge. He dropped out of seminary when he was arrested and convicted.Lester Hunt Jr was not elected official and a little bit further to the left politically than his father. He had the luxury of speaking out on liberal issues more than his father did. This did not go unnoticed by Sen. Joe McCarthy. Lester Hunt Jr voted for Truman in 1948 for practical reasons, but his heart was with Henry Wallace.McCarthyâ€™s witch hunt against Communists is well known, but his witch hunt against gays is not as well known. So this was a time when we had Joe McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover, and Roy Cohn (McCarthyâ€™s right hand man) waging a war against gay people as they themselves had homosexual feelings and acted on them. Hoover traveled with his companion Clyde Tolson for decades. Hoover dressed in drag on many occasions. Several men have indicated they had sex with McCarthy and Cohn died of AIDS.Lester Hunt was arrested and spent a night in jail too embarrassed to call his parents to bail him out. After Lester Hunt Jrâ€™s arrest and conviction, Sen. Hunt had to make a decision whether to run for re-election to the Senate. Would his sonâ€™s arrest have an impact on his re-election? Every poll taken, even with questions regarding his sonâ€™s arrest, indicated Democrat Sen. Hunt would win Republican Wyoming in a re-election bid. The Senate was tied with the same number of Democrats as Republicans. If Hunt did not win re-election, the Republicans would probably gain control of the Senate.Several Republican Senators, including Joe McCarthy, made it very clear to Sen. Hunt that should he run for re-election they would make sure ever voter in Wyoming knew about his son.Hunt decided to bow out of his re-election race at the last moment sighting health problems, except no one knew of any health problems. The Senator refused to talk about â€œhealth issuesâ€. Another factor may have been when their home had been broken into and ransacked.He and his wife had sat in the courtroom during their sonâ€™s trial. It was obvious it took quite a toll on both of them.Sen. Hunt took his life in 1954. His wife died in 1990. Now in his 80s, Lester Hunt Jr. lives with his wife in Chicago.Gary Miller is a freelance writer, a long time Sacramento area activist and is a member of the Roseville City School Board."

                    "Jonathan Harvey, writer of the jubilant stage and film hit Beautiful Thing and the gleefully garish BBC2 sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, is reflecting on growing up gay in Liverpool in the 1980s. â€œIt was a tough, macho place that I couldnâ€™t wait to get out of,â€ recalls the 49-year-old. â€œIt was obviously easier then than in the 1960s but thatâ€™s still not to say it was particularly easy. And I was living in Thatcherâ€™s Liverpool. She really didnâ€™t like the city and sheâ€™d decimated it. Iâ€™ve moved back since but I had to get out to come out.â€ It was while in London that he saw the original 1992 National Theatre production of Angels in America. â€œIt was genuinely life-changing. Whenever there was anything about HIV and Aids in the papers, Iâ€™d turn the page. I just assumed weâ€™d all succumb to it in the end and be wiped out. And then here I was, slap bang in the front row at the Cottesloe theatre. It made me wake up and go, â€˜Fucking hell, youâ€™ve got to take responsibility.â€™ I became politicised about my sexuality and itâ€™s probably scant coincidence that I wrote Beautiful Thing six months later. That was my seventh play but my first with a gay theme.â€",
                    "His latest, Mister Tuesday, is a bittersweet vignette, one of seven 15-minute pieces by gay writers that make up Outlaws to In-Laws â€“ each set in a different decade, from the 1950s to the present day. This history of gay male lives in England is directed by Mary Franklin. When Harvey was invited to take part, he plumped immediately for the 1960s, to write about a man in 1965 â€“ two years before homosexuality was decriminalised â€“ who threatens his married lover with blackmail to deter him from a break-up. â€œItâ€™s such an interesting period. Social change was up in the air and decriminalisation was on the horizon but it was all still dangerous. The rules of the day were like a blackmailersâ€™ charter.â€",
                    "Portmanteau productions can have a cobbled-together, Frankensteinâ€™s Monster feel to them but he insists thereâ€™s a continuity to this one. â€œOf course youâ€™ve got a sense of progress, hence the title. But thereâ€™s still a lot of anger going on here â€“ thereâ€™s Aids, thereâ€™s Clause 28.â€ Issues of race also surface in two plays set in starkly different periods. In Jonathan Kempâ€™s Reward, a black teenager and a National Front skinhead fall for each other during the Queenâ€™s silver jubilee celebrations and discover an unexpected kinship. And in Topher Campbellâ€™s Brothas 2.0, two black friends in the early 2000s peruse the profiles on a dating website that is visible to the audience, exploring the disparity between their digital and corporeal selves.",
                    "Kemp was 10 in 1977, when his play takes place. â€œChoosing the decade Iâ€™d grown up in was a way of unpacking and trying to make sense of it. Even though I was around then, Iâ€™d been too young to experience the full impact or to really understand what was going on.â€ Despite the setting, he says Reward is also a comment on race in modern gay life. â€œThe Black Lives Matter movement was just starting when I was writing the play and it felt apposite to what I wanted to address. Racism is prevalent in the gay community but then thereâ€™s no reason why it wouldnâ€™t be. Just because someoneâ€™s gay and in a sexual minority doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll make connections with other oppressed minorities and express compassion or goodwill.â€ Gay dating apps in particular are an area where prejudice is often expressed brazenly. â€œLook at Grindr and Scruff and youâ€™ll see profiles that say â€˜No blacksâ€™ or â€˜No Asiansâ€™ or whatever. Itâ€™s a big problem in the queer community.â€",
                    "Brothas 2.0 approaches race from a different angle, focusing on the opportunities that the internet opened up for people outside the white gay mainstream. Campbell explains: â€œI wanted to say something about the 00s because of how the internet impacted on peopleâ€™s lives and sex lives and identities. In particular for black men who have sex with men, it created an important space given our minority status. There arenâ€™t that many places for black people generally to meet so cyberspace provided something that real space wasnâ€™t offering.â€ ",
                    "The play explores the complicated layers of performance involved for the macho Dwayne, who resists the word â€œgayâ€, which he regards as synonymous with â€œwhiteâ€ and therefore â€œsoftâ€, and doesnâ€™t message people he desires for fear of seeming weak. His friend Femi, on the other hand, frequents saunas and still prizes old-fashioned physical interaction. â€œFemi is supposedly lower down on the scale of commercial attractiveness but in fact he has the better sex life because he doesnâ€™t have the pressures of keeping up appearances that Dwayne has.â€",
                    "Campbell is 45 but thereâ€™s no suggestion from Brothas 2.0 of any censorious attitude toward the behaviour of his juniors; his play is superficially the liveliest of the seven. â€œThe others are quite gentle,â€ he says. â€œI designed it deliberately to be high-energy because Iâ€™m the only black writer. I wanted it to have a different flavour.â€ Thereâ€™s also a cautious enthusiasm expressed about the way people hook up in the digital era rather than nostalgia for how dating used to be. â€œItâ€™s not easy to bump into people on the tube or bus and not everyone wants to go to nightclubs and dance around with their tits out. So where are you going to go? Gentrification in London is decreasing the spaces where LGBT people can meet and thereâ€™s a lot of pressure. We live in a click-and-collect society now. We can get our stuff brought to us from Tesco and Deliveroo and we consume each other as well.â€ ",
                    "Though the remit of Outlaws to In-Laws is to address the gay male experience in England (sex between women never having been criminalised), itâ€™s disappointing to find that not one of the seven male playwrights has found room for a female character. â€œI canâ€™t defend it,â€ Harvey admits, â€œthough theyâ€™re all very short pieces and thereâ€™s only so much you can do in that time.â€ Still, it would be churlish to deny the playâ€™s value as social history. â€œItâ€™s about people taking stock,â€ he says. â€œGay men havenâ€™t all been off having children, so historically our stories wonâ€™t have survived. These plays should feel a bit like watching an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? and seeing where you came from. Itâ€™s a family tree that could easily die out. Thatâ€™s why I think nights like this in the theatre are important. Thatâ€™s a grand word but itâ€™s about nailing your colours to the mast and saying, â€˜Donâ€™t forget, all this happened to give you the privileges youâ€™ve got today.â€™â€ "

                    "The term â€œqueer ecologyâ€ refers to a loose, interdisciplinary constellation of practices that aim, in different ways, to disrupt prevailing heterosexist discursive and institutional articulations of sexuality and nature, and also to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics in light of queer theory. Drawing from traditions as diverse as evolutionary biology, LGBTTIQQ2SA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, questioning, two-spirited, and allies) movements, and queer geography and history, feminist science studies, ecofeminism, and environmental justice, queer ecology currently highlights the complexity of contemporary biopolitics, draws important connections between the material and cultural dimensions of environmental issues, and insists on an articulatory practice in which sex and nature are understood in light of multiple trajectories of power and matter.",
                    "In The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault lays the groundwork for much contemporary queer ecological scholarship in his observation that, beginning in the nineteenth century, modern regimes of biopower came to conceive of sex as a specific object of scientific knowledge, organized through, on the one hand, a â€œbiology of reproductionâ€ that considered human sexual behavior in relation to the physiologies of plant and animal reproduction, and on the other, a â€œmedicine of sexâ€ that conceived of human sexuality in terms of desire and identity (1978, 54). Although Foucault rightly notes the tenuous early connections between the two discourses, the establishment of sex as a matter of biopolitical truth could not help but be connected to ideas of nature, and especially to racialized, sexualized, and other anxieties over hygiene and degeneracy. In this context, the figure of the homosexual came to haunt the margins of emerging discourses in urban development, environmental health, and even wilderness preservation: the effeminate homosexual and the lesbian gender invert were not only seen increasingly as against nature but also sometimes considered symptoms of the toxic underside of industrial, urban, and increasingly cosmopolitan modernity.",
                    "In this context, a prehistory of queer ecology must include the attempts of such authors as AndrÃ© Gide and Radclyffe Hall to turn these discourses on their heads (famously, of course, Oscar Wilde embraced his position â€œagainstâ€ nature). Specifically, the placement of sexual desire and orientation in the purview of evolutionary concern gave rise not only to the articulation of homosexuality with degeneracy but also to the possibility that a variety of sexual practices and identities could be understood as â€œnaturalâ€ and, therefore, morally neutral; indeed, early sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote, in 1905, that â€œone might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the populationâ€ (9). Drawing on the rich historical inclusion of same-sex (male) eroticism in pastoral literatures, Gideâ€™s Corydon (published in four parts from 1911 to 1920) thus pursued the idea that the homosexual activities of boy-shepherds represented a more authentic and innocent sexuality than the heterosexual conventions they needed to learn in order to enter into adult relations of (enforced) heterosexuality (Shuttleton 2000). Similarly, Hallâ€™s Well of Loneliness (1928) painted a tragic portrait of a lesbian gender invert who was, if anything, by nature nobler and more moral than any of the other characters in the book (a portrayal that caused the book to be banned in Britain, see Mortimer-Sandilands 2008b). Although both texts were thoroughly steeped in the class, racialized, and gender politics of the era and are problematic for a host of reasons associated with neopastoral literatures more broadly (Corydon is deeply misogynist; The Well is profoundly nationalist; both deploy nature as an agent of conservatism), they and others played an important role in setting the conceptual stage for more recent attempts to queer nature and ecology. Indeed, despite their considerable political differences, one can place in productive conversation with Gide and Hall such phenomena as the post-Stonewall emergence of gay and lesbian-feminist anti-urbanisms (Herring 2007; Kleiner 2003; Sandilands 2002) and the more recent articulation of (some) discourses on urban cruising and public sex with organicist renderings of eroticism, freedom, and opposition to heteronormative productions of/restrictions on urban public space (Gandy 2012; Ingram 2010).",
                    "From these roots, beginning in the mid-1990s (e.g., Undercurrents 1994; Gaard 1997), a distinct body of queer ecological scholarship has emerged that has attempted to develop theoretical and activist connections between sexual and ecological politics, often drawing from ecofeminist and environmental justice perspectives and including concerted attention to the racialized, gendered, colonial, and species politics with which notions of sex and nature are articulated (especially as influenced by the writings of Donna Haraway, e.g., 1991b). As Rachel Stein writes, â€œby analyzing how discourses of nature have been used to enforce heteronormativity, to police sexuality, and to punish and exclude those persons who have been deemed sexually transgressive, we can begin to understand the deep, underlying commonalities between struggles against sexual oppression and other struggles for environmental justiceâ€ (2004, 7). This emphasis on the intersectional politics of sexuality, race, and ecology informs the work of Dayna Scott (2009) and Giovanna Di Chiro (2010), both of whom develop critical responses to the â€œgender-bendingâ€ impacts of endocrine-disrupting hormones in the environment (which particularly affect racialized and indigenous communities) while simultaneously disrupting heterosexist panics about the so-called feminization of organisms and populations of organisms, human and otherwise. Beth Berila (2004), Stacy Alaimo (2010a), and Mel Chen (2012) likewise examine the politics of contamination as toxic affects move in, through, and as gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies: as Chen writes powerfully, toxic substances and discourses organize worlds in which some biopolitical subjects are enabled and their life optimized by medical and environmental interventions at the same time as other subjects are themselves considered toxic, expellable, and expendable. And Eli Clare (1999) treats the intersections of class and disability in his account of (among other things) the varied exclusions of an urban environmental politics and aesthetics that pays scant critical attention to the ways in which people work and move in natural environments, and also to bodies and landscapes that are abjected in the production and management of the pristine.",
                    "Sharing similar roots but on a slightly different trajectory, beginning in the late 1990s (although drawing on a longer line of inquiry, see Terry 2000), research in animal behavior by the likes of Bruce Bagemihl (1999) and Joan Roughgarden (2004) has drawn popular attention to the fact that a large array of animal species include elements of same-sex eroticism in their sexual repertoires; in so doing, this research has attempted to dislodge heterosexual reproduction from its singularly privileged place in evolutionary biology, to connect notions of sexual diversity with biological diversity (for a critique, see McWhorter 2010), and to open the door for a nonteleological reconsideration of animal/human sociality and pleasure (Alaimo 2010b; Johnson 2011). As homonormative popular culture has embraced so-called queer animals in the midst of a larger naturalization of same-sex marriage (especially â€œgayâ€ male penguins, see Sturgeon 2010), and as images of polymorphously perverse animal and invertebrate sex have come to populate the ideosphere in the service of sexual pluralism (Green Porno 2009), several scholars suggest ways in which this queering of the more-than-human could proceed in more critical directions. Elizabeth Wilson (2002) and Myra Hird (2004, 2008) consider the ways in which nonhuman sexual and gender diversity both calls into question human exceptionalism and destabilizes notions of identity, authenticity, and technology on which modern categories of human sexual orientation rest; Karen Barad (2012), deploying a notion of queer performativity to strong posthumanist ends, explores the ways in which the material world can be understood as unfolding according to a process of relational co-constitution in which materialization itself can be understood queerly (see also Morton 2010); and several authors call upon the queer potentialities of Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s thought in order to nudge queer and trans theory to think more ecologically, in other words, to consider sexual and gender becomings as complex biological, technological, and political assemblages rather than as either purely discursive or biologically determined processes (Parisi 2008; MacCormack 2009; Chisholm 2010; Hayward 2008Â and, for a critique,Â Garrard 2010).",
                    "Recent scholarship has drawn from combinations of these theoretical trajectories (and beyond) to generate a proliferating array of queer ecological possibilities, including provocative considerations of cross-species and eco-sexualities as part of an ethico-political opening of love to include more-than-human corporealities (e.g.,Â Kuzniar 2008; Sandilands 2004; Stephens and Sprinkle 2012); of the implications of queer theorist Lee Edelmanâ€™s critique of reproductive futurism for ecological politics (Giffney 2008; Anderson 2011; Seymour 2013); and of canonical literary texts, reread and restaged in light of queer ecological concerns (Estok 2011; Azzarello 2012). In addition, new forms of specifically ecoqueer activism, demonstrating interesting forms of coalitional politics in opposition to homonormative agendas, are also emerging in response to such concerns as violence, space, and food (Hogan 2010; Sbicca 2012). In both theoretical and activist milieux, however, questions remain about the specific meaning of the term â€œqueer,â€ given its historically and politically unstable relations to LGBTTIQQ2SA communities and activisms; the current constellation of queer ecologiesâ€”including as it does both more conventional lgbt histories and communities and more recent challenges to these terms and political affinitiesâ€”may be on the verge of something new."

                    "The discovery of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is the single most important scientific medical discovery since the recognition of sterile surgical technique. As our knowledge expands, we are coming to realize that the ECS is a master control system of virtually all physiology.Â  However, research and education of medical students involving the ECS is being intentionally restricted by politics. No justification can be made for the restriction of the scientific study of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system.",
                    "The total effect of the ECS is to regulate homeostasis and prevent disease and aging. The more we learn,Â the more we realize that we are in the infancy of this scientific field of study.Â  The ECS is a control system that involves tissue receptor proteins, cellular communication and control, molecular anatomy and the scavenging of oxygen free radicals. This new field of science will change medicine forever and prove cannabis theÂ gold standardÂ for many disease processes. Its effect on scavenging oxygen free radicals is applicable to all disease processes and this is why it has such wide medical applicationÂ and is considered a cure-all by many. The discovery of the ECS will replace the current medical system of managing and treating disease. Instead of management of symptoms after disease has occurred, we will prevent disease and cancer by manipulation of the ECS.What is the danger of providing government-grown and tested cannabis to researchers? Diversion of research cannabis for non-scientific or recreational purposes does not seem to be a serious threat to national security. MethodsThe directors of the curriculum of the 157 accredited American medical schools (across all 50 states),Â were contacted initially by phone,Â then follow-up email. We asked the following questions:1.Â Do you have a department of ECS (Endocannabinoid Science) with a director?2.Â Do you teach the ECS as an organized course?3.Â Do you mention the ECS in any ancillary classes like pathophysiology, neuroanatomy or pharmacology?Resistance to the Survey Our surveyors found a lot of resistance to answering questions,Â and we had to alter our technique for asking these pointed questions. Many people were unaware of what the word endocannabinoid actually meant. We were asking the medical schools if they were teaching a subject that many of them had no knowledge of. We initially called stating Dr.Â David Allen,Â a retired cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon,Â was sponsoring the study. This led to reluctance, suspicion and refusal to answer our questions. We had reactions like, â€œWho wants to know this?â€ and â€œWhy do you want to know this information?â€ We quickly realized there was significant resistance to our questions.Â We then decided to pose asÂ medical studentsÂ looking to apply to an institution that specialized in the study of the ECS.Â This worked well,Â and we were able to acquire many responses from the office staff of curriculum directors. The directors were frequently not available and often too busy to talk to us. However, this change in technique made data collection easier and curriculum staff more cooperative and affable.",
                    "Responses:",
                    "Here are some of the responses to the questions asked in this survey, ranging from passive-aggressive to blissfully ignorant:- I doubt you will find a school that has a department of endocannabinoid science.- How do you spell endocannabinoid?- We have a few lectures that speak to the topic of the cannabinoid system. That is the extent of our curriculum in that area.- Youâ€™re a prospective student? Not with these kinds of questions you arenâ€™t. If you are an applicant you can call the admissions office.- Are you aware what type of institution we are? Why would we offer that here?- The topic hasnâ€™t gained enough traction or notoriety on this campus to be fully exploredâ€¦ Yâ€™know what I mean?- I have no idea what that is.- You will have some very brief exposure to cannabinoid receptors and their effects in our curriculum.- No course would touch upon this subject longer than five minutes.- There are 12 mentions of cannabinoids in the curriculum database but no mention of the endocannabinoid system.- We donâ€™t teach anything like that at this school- If it is mentioned, it is not a particular focus or talking point. I havenâ€™t heard the endocannabinoid system come up in conversation.- This is a school for people who want to become â€œdoctors.â€- I never heard of it. We probably donâ€™t teach it.- Why are you asking that question? I donâ€™t believe thatâ€™s an appropriate question.Â  I wouldnâ€™t waste other faculty memberâ€™s time with that question.However, a few responses gave our team some hope for the future of this science.- Yes we touch upon it in some of our biochemistry courses. The benefit of being at a small school is our ability to conduct more specialized research.- We do not teach the endocannabinoid system, but we do have a research lab dedicated to that issue.- Three of our physicians include the endocannabinoid system in a lecture.- VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine) has a leading researcher in the area of cannabinoids. There are numerous possibilities to attend seminars on the latest research in that area.Some may criticize this studyâ€™s accuracy, but the resulting numbers are so overwhelming that, even considering room for error, there is a clear failure of the medical establishment to overcome political repression of scientific knowledge. There is no reason our potential medical doctors should be ignorant of this important physiologic control mechanism.Â  This is similar to ignoring a medical field like neuroanatomy.The majority of people in the United States have no idea of the remarkable, scientifically-proven medical benefits of cannabis. These cannabinoids are responsible for massive reductions in diabetes, stroke and myocardial scars.Â  Many cancers show significant responses to cannabinoids by:1. Inhibition of growth of the tumor2.Â Reduction in metastasis (blood and lymphatic spread of the cancer)3.Â Inhibition of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor),Â which inhibits blood vessel growth into tumors (inhibiting vasculogenesis)4.Â Induction of apoptosis (normal cell death that cancer cells are immune to) Glucose and fatty metabolism, pain control and inflammation are all controlled by the ECS. There are many reports of patients with seizures that are unresponsive to all medicines except cannabis extracts. We are learning that even the sperm implantation into the ovum requires endocannabinoids for success. Motherâ€™s milk contains endocannabinoids that stimulate the infant to feed and thrive. (This transfer of cannabinoids from mother to child is the only still legal transfer of exogenous cannabinoids).Prohibitionists will claim that no political repression of the science exists. They will claim that there are adequate scientific studies being funded, but the application process for scientific study of cannabis is nearly impossible to complete successfully. Dr.Â Donald Abrams is famous for being rejected for submitting numerous cannabis studies designed to prove benefits from this medication. After many denials,Â Dr. Abrams changed his tactic and asked to do a study to ascertain if cannabis caused changes in AIDS drugs that would make them less effective or more toxic. This study was approved for government funding because it asked to study the negative effects of cannabis. Fortunately, this study showed cannabis does not make the AIDS drug more toxic or less effective. The Catch 22 for cannabis is that, in effect, the government states, â€œThere are no studies that prove cannabis safety,Â therefore,Â it should remain in a class of dangerous drugs that are prohibited from scientific study.â€ Because cannabis has not been studied, it is a Schedule I drug. Because it is a Schedule I drug, it cannot be studied.Obviously, there can be no justification for repression of scientific study on any subject, especially the scientific study of a plant with unprecedented medical benefits and a lack of harmful side effects. When scientific knowledge is illegal, the truth does not exist. Americans for Safe Access (ASA) has a very illuminating study on the political repression of the scientific study of cannabis in this country that is well worth reading(http://americansforsafeaccess.org/downloads/Research_Obstruction_Report.pdf)ResultsThe results of the study are predictable, so no one should be surprised!Â  Not one of the medical schools surveyed had a department of endocannabinoid science or an ECS director. None of them taught the endocannabinoid science as an organized course. Only 21 of the 157 schools surveyed had the ECS mentioned in any course.Â  21/157 = 13.3%In the United States of America,Â only 13% of the medical schools surveyed teach the endocannabinoid science to our future doctors. ConclusionThe purpose of this study was to point out the absurdity of ignoring a new science. We would hope this study causes medical schools to rethink their position and welcome this new science. We call on the Deans of all medical schools to start organized courses in cannabinoid receptor science and its modulating effects on homeostasis. If the medical schools in your state do not teach the endocannabinoid science,Â you can discuss ways toÂ  incorperate the study of the ECS into their curriculum.Humans have a hard time believing in things they canâ€™t see. Prior to the invention of the microscope,Â no medical schools taught sterile technique to their students because bacteria were unseen. You should research the name Ignaz Semmelweis and how the medical community treated his epiphany and scientific medical discovery. Dr Semmelweis referred to the physicians of the day as â€œignoramuses.â€Â  It may be time for todayâ€™s physicians to catch up with the science of the times. The discovery of the ECS is proving it to be a master control system for physiology. Recent studies show long-term use of cannabis decreases the incidence of diabetes by 66%. US patents prove CBD,Â a component of cannabis,decreases the size of a stroke by 50%. Other studies show a 66% reduction in the size of a heart scar after a heart attack. The sum of this information means that cannabis augments the bodyâ€™s own natural endocannabinoid system. Cannabis is not just a pharmaceutical; it is more properly termed aÂ nutraceutical.Â Consumption of raw or uncooked cannabis, does not get you high, but has miraculous anti-oxidant effects from the acid forms of cannabinoids.Â Your body needs cannabis on a nutritional basis to prevent disease.Â  You donâ€™t need a medical diagnosis to benefit from cannabis,Â as everyone can benefit from the antioxidant effects. As you can see,Â this concept will change medicine as we know it,Â including the distribution of money. The business of medicine will no longer be treatment-based, it will be prevention-based.The big picture is that the ECS is a control system of physiology that will not be ignored. You can pretend the ECS doesnâ€™t exist or question its importance. People once questioned the significance of handwashing prior to surgical procedures because bacteria are unseen by the naked eye. People may not understand the complex science behind this medicine, but they knowÂ immediately when they use cannabis that it has some beneficial effects. The price that people are willing to pay for cannabis should be a good barometer on how well people think the medicine works. Only organized,Â double blinded scientific studies of cannabis will prove its true benefits or potential harm. Unfortunately,Â the politics behind prohibition prevent this from happening to any significant degree.Ask yourself, â€œWhy is scientific study of cannabis and the ECS restricted in the USA? What possible justification could explain this? Why should the education of medical students exclude this critical control system of physiology and health?â€ We encourage you to call the Dean of your local medical school and ask if they plan on teaching this science to our future doctors. When will this war end and the healing start? All wars mean big business for somebody. This war is being funded, and that is why it still continues. Stop the funding and the war will end. Jury nullification and education of the public on the truth about cannabis are the best ways to stop this war onÂ us. Read and teach. Dr. David B.

But then an evil thing threatens to blow stuff up, and the only people who can combat it are the Moon and Sun priestesses, who happen to be Chikane and Himeko. They then go off on a (sexually-confused) epic fantasy quest to save the Earth!",
                    "Awhile back, a friend and I decided that it would be fun to pick a short anime series that we knew nothing about and watch it in one night. Now I'm sure this is still a fun thing to do in most cases. But I'm afraid it's very unfortunate that we chose Destiny of the Shrine Maiden as our first series to do this with. Because right now, I don't feel very up to trying such an experiment again, ever. Why, do you ask?\n",
                    "Because Destiny of the Shrine Maiden proved to be a bad anime. A very bad anime.\n",
                    "I like mecha, I like fantasy and fantasy heroines, and I like science fiction. However, I should've known that something was up with a series that advertised all of those things at once. Sure, it could work, it has worked, but it usually doesn't. It sure didn't with Destiny of the Shrine Maiden, and the results were disastrous. I did get some mecha, some Victorian fantasy (complete with maids), and some science fiction, all in one series. But the quality of these elements was down the tubes. They put in mecha so that they could sell this to mecha fans, but they didn't really care about the mecha. They put in fantasy so they could sell this to fantasy fans, but they didn't care about that either. Same goes with the sci-fi elements. The result is a series that rips off just about every type of anime fan in existence. The best I can say about this odd mish-mash of genres is that it's the closest thing to a hilarious cross-over that I've ever seen. If anyone dared to produce Macross in Hanaukyo, they would end up with something like this.\n",
                    "Overshadowing all of Destiny of the Shrine Maiden's generic shortcomings mentioned above, however, is the most offensive marketing ploy in this basket case of a show. Remember that Destiny of the Shrine Maiden, on top of all the mecha and maids mess, also calls itself a romance anime ... a yuri romance anime. Although I was not prepared for this when I first started the series, I was ready to take the yuri theme and run with it. But they didn't care about the romance element any more than they cared about the other stuff. It's sloppy, forced romance. If it had been completely heterosexual, it would have been sloppy, forced romance, and worthy of the same contempt. Why do they put in such romance? So that they can introduce a load of yuri scenes? Why do they introduce a load of yuri scenes? So that they can they can sell homosexuality as some strange and exotic product; a freak show of sorts. When Destiny of the Shrine Maiden tries to sell mecha, sci-fi, and fantasy in this manner, it is annoying. When they begin doing it with lesbianism, it becomes EXTREMELY offensive. Because such exploitation was the main priority of this show, among all the other wily tricks up it's sleeve, it sinks to the lowest levels of \"entertainment\" as far as I'm concerned. The whole thing is really a way to make money off of lesbianism, while pulling in every other type of fan it can at the same time. Not only is that against my principles of why anime (or any product) should be created, but it's just not entertaining to watch, period.\n",
                    "One last thing to mention is that, despite the clashing genres displayed on the front design, the advertisement art did manage to trick me into thinking that the visuals of this series would be very good. Well, the old trickster got me again. This series looks horrible, like a totally average series from the mid-90s. This is totally unacceptable, considering they probably did the entire thing on a computer, and could've at least made it look better than Gainax's super-low-budget stuff from the 90s. But they didn't manage to do this, and it shows. Backgrounds are bland, and characters are very pointy and plain.\n",
                    "That's just one little morsel to add to the top of this heaping pile of junk.",
                    "If you like awkward lesbian romances, lesbian-lesbian-mechademon love triangles, or unexciting lesbian fan service, then you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  If you like awkward lesbian romances, lesbian-lesbian-mechademon love triangles, or unexciting lesbian fan service, then you really need to get out more.  â€” Connor McCarty",
                    "Recommended Audience: Nobody really. Anybody who'd actually enjoy this exploitation needs to get their head examined. However, if for some reason you're actually considering watching this thing, you have to be prepared for a whole bunch of lesbian scenes. So know what you can handle and what you can't. And these themes get pretty maturely sexual later on, from what I've heard. Pair that with some spastic violence and destruction, and nobody under 15 should really be watching this. But as I said, no one still ALIVE should be watching this."

                    "Itâ€™s 1994 and Iâ€™m doodling in my notebook during Mr. Harkinsâ€™s Biblical Theology class. I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn around to see a red-faced Brian Huppe handing me a folded piece of paper, his grin bearing shiny silver braces. I take the paper and unfold it to find the note he wrote me. It reads â€œwe know what you are (a lesbo). Go back to where you came from.â€ Ingesting the words feels like swallowing glass. I donâ€™t care that he thinks I might fancy girls, but I know thatâ€™s beside the point when he chooses to call me a â€œlesbo.â€ I ask Mr. Harkins for the hall pass and dart into the bathroom to recover. I look in the mirror, seeking answers as to why Iâ€™m a target for schoolboy cruelty. Iâ€™m a punk rock alterna-girl in a Midwestern parochial school so thereâ€™s very little self-expression possible without violating the dress code. My hair is cropped in a short bob. Instead of a tartan skirt, Iâ€™m wearing navy blue polyester grandpa golf pants I bought at the Goodwill. Around my neck is a rhinestone encrusted cat collar. Iâ€™m 15, chubby, and freckle-faced with chipmunk teeth and all I want is the freedom to express myself without persecution from basic boys like Brian. A few years later, in the spring of my senior year, my favorite teacher Mr. Steinberg shares with me an essay written by a female student whose name I donâ€™t remember. The essay is about style. The student chose me as her subject, writing that my style is â€œuniqueâ€ and â€œfearless.â€ Iâ€™m incredibly flattered to know that my sartorial choices inspired a girl I didnâ€™t even know.",
                    "After high school, my budding sexuality influences my personal style. I call my look â€œLatent Lolita,â€ inspired partly by Betsey Johnson, riotgrrls, and Courtney Loveâ€™s â€œkinderwhoreâ€ phase. I kick around in oxblood Doc Martens with lacy knee high stockings. I wear delicate vintage crinoline skirts as outerwear paired with too small baby tees that have cartoon characters like the Powerpuff Girls on them. You can see my black underwear through my slip because I want you to see it. My style is a carefully mediated provocation, an opportunity to point the middle finger at conventional modesty. I am met with disapproving eyes by women and leering eyes by creepy older men. My co-workers at the pizza place where I wait tables during undergrad shake their heads. One of them tells me my style is â€œwrong.â€ Keeping true to my punk rock roots, I donâ€™t give a fuck about what any of them think about what I wear.",

My father worries that I am partying too much and not living up to my potential. His work transfers him to Boston and even though Iâ€™ve been out of the house for six years at this point, he strongly suggests I join the family in the move to the East Coast. Despite the fact that I am an adult who can make her own decisions, I feel the need to obey my father. I leave behind my wild nights for a sleepy harbor town where my only friends are my much younger siblings.

                    "To get to Pioneer Investments in Bostonâ€™s financial district, I have to take a ferry. Every time I board the ferry I am reminded of the opening scene from the 1988 Melanie Griffith movie Working Girl about a secretary from Staten Island who works her way to the top. The Carly Simon song â€œLet the River Runâ€ that underscores the filmâ€™s opening plays in my head. I love this movie. Because itâ€™s the 1980s, Melanie Griffith and her friend, played by Joan Cusack, have hair as high as a skyscraper. Their makeup and clothes borrow from a noisy color palette. Their sartorial choices demarcate themselves from the upper echelon of Wall Street. In this film, style is a mark of social class where the lower classed characters are more sartorially expressive than their elegantly muted upper class counterparts. Despite my earnest attempts to fit in and wear my version of â€œbiz cajâ€ in my financial industry job, I stick out like a sore thumb. I have no business being there. I donâ€™t care about money and I donâ€™t care about pleasing the type of people who work in middle management. One day my manager, Komal, takes me aside for a little chat about my work performance. She suggests I tone down my wardrobe. â€œWouldnâ€™t you rather be known as Megan the hard worker instead of Megan who wears bright colors?â€ I look down at my yellow cowl-necked sweater and my turquoise corduroy Marc Jacobs skirt. Aside from my morning coffee, my brightly colored clothes are the only source of joy at this job. And besides, Iâ€™m a telephone representative. I could show up to work wearing pasties, a jockstrap and some wellies and the customers would be none the wiser. I resign myself to a wardrobe of beige and tweeds because at this point in my life I donâ€™t feel like fighting to be myself anymore.",
                    "Thankfully my time at Pioneer Investments is cut short by my decision to move back to Kansas City after the loneliest nine months of my life. I return to a buzzing social life and a slightly matured version of my Latent Lolita look. I pick back up with the burlesque troupe I performed with before Boston, the Burly Q Girly Crew, who are chosen to accompany the electroclash pop star Peaches during her performances in Austin, Texas during the South By Southwest music festival. That week in March of 2006 was a whirlwind of outrageous excess. Our terrorist drag-style burlesque is a perfect complement to Peachesâ€™s make â€™em gag aesthetic. A few months later while drinking porch beers with my roommates, I get a phone call from my fellow Burly Qâ€™er, Taylor. She asks me if Iâ€™m anywhere near a Glamour magazine. I tell her thereâ€™s a Walgreenâ€™s down the street so yeah. â€œWhy, Taylor? Are you in it?â€ â€œNo, girl. You are. Youâ€™re a Glamour Donâ€™t!â€ I remember loving the Dos and Donâ€™ts feature when I thumbed through my motherâ€™s copies of Glamour. I always wondered who these women were with the bars over their eyes, if they knew theyâ€™d end up as a fashion casualty splashed on the glossy pages of Glamour. Well, I can tell you I had no clue that I was being photographed when I was standing on a street corner in Austin. My friends and I drove to the Walgreenâ€™s, grabbed the Glamour, and there I was. My crime? Dressing like a little girl. It was my last day in Austin, and the hot, rainy weather resulted in a confusing outfit that paired a light purple windbreaker with a flouncy green skirt, pink leggings made by my fashion designer pal Peggy Noland, and flip flops. It wasnâ€™t my greatest fashion moment but it wasnâ€™t my worst either. While I can imagine that most women would be mortified if they ended up a Glamour Donâ€™t, I am not most women. As a lover of irreverence, I thrive on mortification. Being called a â€œDonâ€™tâ€ by a so-called fashion authority was the pinnacle of my personal style. My mere presence was constantly being met with â€œnopesâ€ by peers and higher ups, and instead of bowing to their complaints, I prided myself for daring to go against standard conventions of style in a world beholden to the normal.",
                    "I left Kansas City for New York City in the fall of 2007. You think you know what weird is until you spend an evening in the East Village. The streets are filled with punk rock bohemians who express themselves through their dress no matter their age. Living in New York, I thrived on the anonymity and the freedom to dress however I pleased without comment. Like many women, as I approached my thirties, I started to tone down my fashion daringness. Not because I was concerned about â€œdressing my age,â€ I just no longer welcomed attention from anyone, negative or otherwise. Today, clothes are a necessity to get from point A to point B. If I could wear a cloak of invisibility, I would. I do not know if this is a response to caring less about wanting to provoke people, or the sad effect of societal apathy towards women over a certain age. At this particular point in my life, after years of being a clothing iconoclast, my current style is in a fit of flux. I waver between phoning it in in the name of comfort, or dressing to impress when Iâ€™m out at drag shows in Chicagoâ€™s Boystown. While I tend to dress with uncertainty today, I do know that when I reach my 70s, I have every intention of returning to my roots, adopting the style of the punk rock grannies I saw strutting the streets of New York City with Manic Panic dyed hair, miniskirts, fishnets and combat boots who refuse to go quietly into that good night."

                    "\nThis line of thinking, elaborated by biologists Robert Trivers and James\nWeinrich, among others, is that gay people may have evolved character traits of\nan altruistic nature that prompt them to work harder for the protection and\nadvancement of closely related family members rather than invest in having\nchildren of their own.  This idea, called \"kin altruism,\" results from the\nsimple calculus that two nephews or nieces are genetically equivalent to one\nson or daughter.  Reproductive sacrifice explainable by a theory of kin\naltruism has been demonstrated in some animal species but remains speculative\nfor humans, most of whom, sad to say, seem rather short in the department of\naltruism..  (Cf., Jim Weinrich, Sexual Landscapes: Why We Are What We  Are,\nWhy We Love Whom We Love, 1987.)",
                    "\nRay Blanchard and his colleagues at the Clarke Institute in Toronto recently\nanalyzed thousands of families and found that gay men have a later birth order\nthan straight.  Specifically, the gay men had more older brothers but not more\nolder sisters once the older brothers were taken into account.  A\npsycho-developmental  explanation springs to mind:  A young boy might develop\nhomosexual attractions more readily if an older brother is in the picture.  But\na biological explanation is also on the horizon.  The placenta supporting every\nhuman pregnancy has small protein fingers that engage the mother's bloodstream\nby digging into the wall of her uterus.  When the placenta is shed, some of the\nplacental cells remain in the uterine wall and can be demonstrated to be alive\nand well years later.  These cells came form the fetus and contain its genome.\nIt is possible that some  cells of an  early pregnancy remain behind and, by an\nunexplained mechanism, try to capture the resources of subsequent pregnancies,\na sort of biological primogeniture?  I like this odd (and admittedly remote)\npossibility because it shows how much is still unexpected in the biology of\nhuman sexuality.",
                    "\nBehavior genetics applied to sexual orientation encounters a  variety of\ncriticisms.  In this debate, I feel like a detective who's presenting his case\nto the district attorney.  I have scraps and clues, hypothesis and sometimes\nhang together but that also have gaps.  But the DA must be a skeptic.  He has\nto put my case before a jury whom he must convince beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe standard of proof rises as the investigation proceeds.  (Thanks to Jimm\nWeinrich for the analogy.)   The most I can say is that no one has yet put\nforward evidence that is devastating to my case.",
                    "\ns",
                    "\nThere is one criticism I want at least to touch on, namely that genetics\ntheories pander to homophobia.  If \"gay genes\" are discovered, how much easier\nwill it be to eradicate them?  Opinion surveys are unanimous t hat people who\nendorse a genetic hypothesis are more sympathetic to lesbians and gays than\npeople who hole to a purely environmental theory.  Still, technology ahs a way\nof biting back.  No scientific knowledge is risk-free, and this must surely\ninclude genetic investigations of sexual orientation.  One might take a sort of\nverse comfort in knowing that homophobia, like racism (an all  the\nxenophobias),  exists regardless  of whatever might be considered \"the facts\"\nof the moment.  Research on human sexuality will, by its nature, evoke\nresistance and fear, to some extent legitimately.  Here  is where I think\nsocial science research has a valuable role.   There ought to be funded\nresearch programs not only to unravel the genome but to unravel the ethical and\npsychological dilemmas that accompany the new insights that behavior genetics\nwill generate.",
                    "\nScientific research is permeated by values.  Mine are that it is better to know\nsomething than not to know it.  I believe that same-sex desire will remain a\ntopic of interest and study for a long time.  I'm confident that biological\nknowledge will prove it to be a valuable trait, selected by evolution precisely\nbecause it contributes some quality that was useful, perhaps even essential, to\nthe sudden ascendancy of human beings among all the primates.\n\n\n"

                    "Gay-related immune deficiency (GRID) was the original name for a disease currently known as AIDS. GRID was first mentioned in a May 11, 1982 article in the New York Times.[1] In this article, the term \"A.I.D.\" (Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease) is also mentioned. In the early days of AIDS (i.e., 1982â€“1985), the terms \"gay cancer\" and \"gay plague\" were also used.[2][3][4]",
                    "The term GRID was never used in the scientific biomedical literature. In the popular press, it was only used for a very short period of time.[5] On August 8, 1982, the term AIDS (for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) first appeared in New York Times. It was initially spelled A.I.D.S.[6] The reason for the GRID-to-AIDS change in nomenclature was the realization that the \"gay\" attribution did not fully encompass the demographics of the disease. The use of GRID and gay-related immune deficiency in the popular literature reached a peak in 1995; the terms have rapidly sunk into obsolescence subsequently.",
                    "One reason for the use of \"gay\" in the disease name was that the first recognized cases of AIDS were restricted to gay men, who represented a marginalized group that could be easily further stigmatized.[7] Another reason may have to do with the tendency of people in Western societies to seek meaning in diseased states.[8] This phenomenon was recognized by Susan Sontag a form of punishment, and in her book Illness as Metaphor, she wrote: \"Nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning\".[9] The third reason for the emphasis on sexual orientation may be due to the belief in the Just World Hypothesis, i.e., the claim that we live in a world where people generally get what they deserve. According to this world view, the roots of an affliction must be sought in the victim; as with women who have been raped who must be guilty of seductive behavior, so the reason for AIDS must that those afflicted are guilty of immoral acts.[10]"

                    " Did you know that The Vice Guide to Eating Pussy is still one of the main articles to bring people over to VICE.com? The reason for this is because unless you're five years old, an unadventurous straight girl or some other manner of person who sucks, you've probably had your mouth on a vagina and want to grow better and better in your skills as your life moves forward. Don't you wanna be a winner? Don't you wanna succeed in the ongoing battle of mouth vs. pussy? FUCK YES YOU DO! I figured that maybe it was time for a new guide, from the perspective of someone who both has a vagina, and is also BFFS with vagina (sexually).Â ",
                    " As I was writing that thing that I just wrote about people who may not have ever had their mouth on a vagina, I had to stop and think about what sort of creature would fall into the \"no thanks, no vagina for me\" category. I thought about this for a long time, as though I was trying to solve a particularly difficult math problem because, after eating vagina for TWENTY-ONE years now, I can't imagine life without it. It's one of my major food groups.Â ",
                    " Oh, hello. I'm a humongous lesbian. Perhaps you didn't know that. Fact numero uno about lesbos is that, unless we're chumps/fakers, we know a shit ton about flippy flaps, namely, how to wear one as a hat. Much with anything else in life though, enthusiasm doesn't always equal skill. You can love a thing (like pussy) and still suck at that thing (like eating pussy). In the world of lesbian sex there are two acts that are at the upper echelon of difficulty 1) Strap-ons 2) Going down on a crotch in a really amazing way. This post is going to focus on the second one, and will hopefully be helpful for lesbians, soon to be lesbians, straight dudes, whoever.Â ",
                    " 1) You Are the Boss",
                    " When I saw my first ever naked vagina, aside from my own, I thought that I was going to freak out. A vagina isn't really a pretty thing, and there's a lot going on in there. I found myself sacrificing a great deal of personal and mental comfort (ex. neck pain, sort of falling asleep, killing myself and almost crying because it's taking someone forever to come) to make it like me and to master its ways. I found out through practice and time that if you enter an oral situation thinking \"THIS GIRL MUST COME OR I AM A FAILURE,\" she's probably not gonna come and you're gonna have an awful time and be making all sorts of tense faces down there. Pressure is the worst and will drive away orgasms every time. Picture a farmer trying to herd sheep by just standing in the middle of a field crying and wishing really hard for the sheep to come to them. Getting uptight about making a girl come is shooing away the pussy sheep that you want to bring TO you. The important thing is to have a general feeling like \"I'm putting my face on this vagina because I want to and because I've already seen this week's episode of Mad Men. I don't give a wild crap if it comes.\" Then it will come. I promise.",
                    " 2) Don't do weird flicky shit. Don't do \"tricks.\"Â ",
                    " The worst is when someone is like \"I'm completely gonna blow your mind right now\" and then they bury their face in-between your legs and start scatting on your pubic hairs. My most frequently shared sex stories start with \"this person did the funniest thing to my pussy.\" Don't do funny things to someone's pussy. Don't pull out \"moves.\" Be earnest and calm. I'd say that until you can gauge by moans and whimpers what they like the best (which hopefully you will, unless the girl makes zero noises, which sucks) just start by making your tongue really soft and wide, flatten it out on the pussy, and then proceed with slow and steady laps, like you're enjoying the best ice cream cone ever. Do that really slowly, like sloooooooowwwwww, while wrapping your arms around the girl's thighs. Wait for her to start squirming around, and then kill that fucking clit like it's a spider in the bathtub. If you're doing some crazy nonsense down there and hear something like \"come here, I wanna kiss you,\" that means you fucked up. Don't try to persist, and don't go right back to \"win.\" You lost this pussy game, but think about what you did wrong after the girl goes home, and try again next time. There's nothing wrong with needing practice, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with asking someone what they like.Â ",
                    " 3) Layers",
                    " Vaginas are super fickle. The best way I can explain what I'm thinking right now is to compare vaginas to being super stoned and wanting so many snacks at the same time. Like say you're stoned and all you can think about is Doritos. You want Doritos SO BAD that you're kind of starting to cry about them a little bit. Finally you make your way to the corner store and buy Doritos, but then once you're home, up to your forearm in the bag, you realise that you also really need some fucking chocolate. Vaginas are like this. There will be one ache, one need, one \"hole to fill,\" but you need to throw a lot of shit at that hole to give it what it requires to be satisfied. Have you ever seen that movie Tremors with Kevin Bacon? Picture that worm monster from the movie with all those crazy teeth being the vagina that you're battling, and you're just chucking shovels and slinkies and dirt clods at, whatever it takes to make that hole close up.Â ",
                    " This is actually kind of an easy formula, but don't make it TOO formulaic. Basically the trick to creating a nice, perfectly layered oral sex cake is to start off with the slow and even rhythmic lapping as mentioned before, and then do a bit of clit attacking (focus tip of tongue on clit and kind of push it back and forth like you're trying to balance an M&M on its side) and then slow things down again. When you go from the clit attacking to slowing things down, the girl you're fucking will probably make some sort of \"no, don't stop\" noise, and then you're gonna take three fingers and shove them in her vagina about half way, curling them up towards you and securing the tips of them in the grabby bone ledge while continuing to lap. I'm sure there's a medical term for that grabby bone ledge, but I don't know what it is. If you want to put your other hand to work as well, take the palm of your hand and press it down on the lower stomach/top of pubic bone while doing all the other stuff at the same time. I'm not sure what this does exactly, but girls seem to like it.Â ",
                    " I hope this helps. Oh, and if you remember only ONE thing, remember that that weird sucking thing you do hurts, and blowing into a vagina is a really bad idea.Â ",

                    "Jesus is not unclear about the implications of what it will mean to follow Him: \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.\" (Luke 9:23) Very little in life that's worth much of anything is easy. If what you are doing feels hard and overwhelming at times that doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong; it actually could mean you're doing something very right. The road to redemption is paved with stones of suffering, and only the strongest allow themselves to be weakened by the cross they must carry along the way. That's you, counted among the strongest. Continue to carry it, daily.",
                    "The Bible never promises that following Jesus will be easy; it does, however,Â absolutely guarantee that following Him will be worth it. Galatians 6:9 encourages us to \"...not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.\" Our hope is that our present struggles are not the end of the story, but simply the means to the greater glory that has been promised to us all through Jesus (Romans 8:18). The good news of the gospel in foster care is that, in the end, Jesus wins, even if along the way we wonder why we're doing this and if we can handle it anymore. What you are doing is not in vain. Will it be hard? Absolutely. Will it be worth it? Most definitely. Do not give up in doing good.",
                    "At the core of foster care is a battle that goes largely unseen. We are not merely participating in a broken human story but in a fractured spiritual one as well.Â We may see signs, but not the whole; shadows, but not the substance of everything that's really going on. It's in that tension of the unseen that Scripture encourages us to \"fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.\" (2 Corinthians 4:18) You are not merely changing the life of a child today but are altering the trajectory of a human soul forever.Â You may not see it now - you may not ever even see it in this lifetime - but what you are doing is of eternal significance. Fix your eyes there.",
                    "I'm not sure how you do foster care without an increasing dependence upon the sovereignty of God over all things. If He's not in control over all of foster care then there's really no hope at all in it.Â Psalm 103:19 declares,Â \"The Lord has established his throne in heaven,Â and his kingdom rules over all.\"Â There are no guarantees in foster care, except one - God is sovereign over all -Â including the circumstances these kids come from and the \"system\" they're now caught in.Â He is good and His kingdom rules, over where they are today and even where they may lay their heads tomorrow. His ability to care for them supersedes anything bad that's been done to them or anything good that we can offer them. He. Is. God. We have to trust that. We get to trust that.",
                    "A consistent theme of hope running throughout the narrative of Scripture is the assurance that when God is near, all is good. When He is with us we do not have to afraid, we do not have to worry, we do not have to wonder. Psalm 46:1 reassures us that,Â \"God is our refuge and strength,Â an ever-present help in trouble.\"Â When He is near, everything changes. He is an always present, always attentive, always engaged God. He weeps over our mourning and sings over our joys. He meets us in our weakness and reminds us in our weariness that He has been there before us and He is there with us now - sympathizing, holding, understanding and encouraging. In the beautiful, sacrificial, redemptive work you are doing of laying yourself down for the sake of these kids know that you are not alone. You are never alone.Â Â "

                    "Fade, a 40 years old Telecommunication officer from the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, is tending his vegetable patch as he does every morning, a commitment he has taken on when his family moved into this little cabin â€“ their temporary home in a refugee camp, known as PIKPA, on the Greek Island of Lesbos. â€œI plant this garden with vegetables for those who come after me. My family and I will have travelled on by the time these are ready to eat, but the next refugees who come here can benefit from itâ€, he says while gently tilling the soil in the early morning sunshine on this bright September day. â€œI had a villa in Syria with land and horses, you know, but the war changed all of that. When I sit here, my mind is still in Syria with our neighbours and friends who havenâ€™t been able to leave. We know Europe is not a paradise. If the war ends, we will return to our own country. My life is in Syria, but for now we need safety.â€",
                    "PIKPA is the name of an old social welfare holiday camp for children established in 1938, situated just a few hundred metres from the Aegean Sea, close to Mytilini Airport in Lesbos, Greece. The site had long since been closed, but in September 2012, a loose group of individuals established a self-help network, initially perceived as an anti-dote to the social and economic devastation Greece suffered from the international banking collapse of 2009. They called their group â€œThe Village of Altogetherâ€. It has expanded since, driven by its ethos of solidarity and mutual support for all people, to fill the vacuum left by official authorities after more and more refugees were drawn to Greek shores from war torn countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and others. The group approached the Mayor of Mytilini, the Islands biggest town, and requested the abandoned holiday camp of PIKPA be used as a facility to accommodate refugees. â€œThe Village of Altogetherâ€ now runs this camp as a safe haven and hospitality centre under the basic concept that all people should be treated with respect and dignity. The autonomous group is devoid of any national or European funding. It has over a hundred affiliated individual members on Lesbos, but an active core of around 10 to 15 people. They provide accommodation for the most vulnerable refugees: the disabled, injured, elderly, pregnant women, single women with children and family groups with very young infants are, if possible, referred to PIKPA. Volunteers offer food, clothes, hygienic facilities, medical help, and legal counselling. Most importantly, they offer a warm, safe and open welcome.",
                    "Mytilini resident Efi Latsoudi is a long time volunteer at PIKPA and active in â€œThe Village of Altogetherâ€ since the beginning. Whilst fielding various calls on her mobile phone and simultaneously coordinating the distribution of dry clothing for newly arrived refugees she recalls: â€œLast week, it was like a war zone here! We had 20,000 very hungry and very tired refugees on the island with no information from the government on where they should exactly go and what the correct procedure for their registration wasâ€. (Each refugee who arrives in Greece must be registered and classified as a legal refugee before they can continue their journey into greater Europe) â€œThe situation here keeps changing, sometimes even on the very same day, so itâ€™s very hard to give concrete information and very difficult for us to co-ordinate everything. The lack of information just creates panic amongst these very vulnerable people.Â  Itâ€™s actually quite simple: you just need to have a set plan of action for administering and processing everyone and then stick to it. You make it logical and you make all the different support groups aware of it and theyâ€™ll explain it to the refugees. It is that simpleâ€¦â€",
                    "With the backlog of 20,000 refugees cleared by a â€œfast trackâ€ system temporarily introduced to alleviate the strain on Lesbosâ€™ infrastructure, the island with a population of 80,000 is still receiving an average of over a thousand new asylum seekers each day. There is no end in sight as warfare still haunts the Middle East. Europe is now experiencing its biggest movement of people since the end of the Second World War. A very sobering thought when trying to come to grips with the magnitude of the refugee situation being faced.",
                    "Ramyar Hassani, a refugee from Kurdistan himself and now a Norwegian citizen, working for another aid group on the island and visiting PIKPA, sums up the situation quite precisely: â€œPIKPA is a good example of how you can run a refugee centre without barbed wire!â€ Additional praise is also coming forth from Erik and Philippa Kempson, an elderly British couple who have lived on the island for over 16 years. Theyâ€™re using their family home in Molivos in the North of Lesbos as an unofficial base for refugee support: â€œPIKPA in Mytilini is the most organised. They do good work over there and are good people. We have so many disabled, injured, and vulnerable people that come over in the boats and need to go to PIKPA. We could actually do with a hundred PIKPAâ€™s on this island.â€",
                    "Dimitria Ippioty is the 25-year-old voluntary nurse at PIKPA. Sheâ€™s unpaid and on call practically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. â€œThe Greeks on this island know about refugeesâ€, she says when asked what motivated her to volunteer for PIKPA. â€œMy grandparents and great grandparents were refugeesâ€ she explains referring to 1922, when many Greeks fled the Turkish siege of Smyrna (Izmir) and crossed the same waters to safety in Lesbos, on the very route that todayâ€™s refugees are coming. â€œI donâ€™t believe that these people wanted to leave their home, but they have no choice. Itâ€™s war. The only solution is, to somehow stop these wars, so people can go home. Until then we must do the best we can to help.â€ And while sheâ€™s examining an elderly man who has just arrived she adds: â€œWe have a lot of people injured during the crossing. Legs cut open as they scramble over the rocks to shore. Also a high amount of mental trauma caused by what theyâ€™ve seen and been through, including the inhuman treatment theyâ€™ve suffered on their journey.â€",
                    "There is, for example, 6-year-old Abdul Masavee with his sister, parents, and grandmother. The family came from Bamiyan in the central highlands of Afghanistan. They crossed the Aegean Sea from Turkey in a flimsy dinghy-type boat, described by Erik Kempson as â€œbits of rubber with the glue coming apart as they cross the waterâ€. Like all people smuggler boats, their dinghy was so overloaded with people, that Abdulâ€™s leg got broken when he was trampled underfoot in the crowded conditions. Today, Abdul is riding in his own wheelchair provided by PIKPA down to the beach for the Masavee familyâ€™s first ever experience of swimming in an ocean. This scene looks so joyous that one may forget the hardships they as a family have endured.",
                    "Around 7 in the morning is the usual time for the first boats of the day coming from Turkey to appear on the horizon. That is why Joel Johansson, the 42-year-old schoolteacher from Sweden and Aeglios Bilious, Air Traffic Controller from Athens, have left Mytilini at 5 am heading for a high point of land on the coast near Molivos, which has become the usual look out point used by volunteers to spot the incoming boats of the day. Both men are using their holiday time to volunteer for PIKPA. Joel has already travelled up to here the previous day and has learnt that more childrenâ€™s trousers are needed, so he brought extra supplies with him today. Now, he and Aeglios are standing together with a small group of fellow volunteers overlooking the narrow ocean gap between Greece and Turkey. Eric and Philippa Kempson are also there, as they have been every morning for the last eight months. With his field glass, Joel can make out three boats coming across bound for the Lighthouse near Molivos, another two boats are heading further down the coast towards Eftalou. Joel and Aeglios travel down to meet the Lighthouse bound refugees with the others heading toward the boats arriving nearer to Eftalou. Hege Bjornebye and Katrine Vatne, both from Norway, are already at the scene on â€œLimantzikiâ€ beach waving some previously discarded orange lifejackets to give the approaching boats a point of reference for landing. â€œThis is apparently illegalâ€ says Hege, with a hint of irony in her voice, referring to the Greek law forbidding any assistance to crossing refugees, even if itâ€™s just in the form of navigational aid. The three boats come in swiftly one after the other. Aeglios wades out to one of the rubber dinghies as it comes to a halt on rocks just short of the beach itself. As usual, children are passed over to be taken ashore first, then it becomes rather unscripted and everyone scrambles out rapidly. Joel has already started to distribute water and tries to establish whether any of this mixed party of Syrians and Afghans speaks English. Once an English speaker is found essential information can be passed on and shared with the whole refugee group. For the moment the scene on the beach is one of jubilation and relief. Hassat Abdul Haman, a 22-year-old Syrian, has dropped to his knees and is thanking God for his safe passage. He and his group have travelled from Syria through Kurdistan and Turkey to here. Both his father and brother have been killed in the war in Syria. Others too are overcome with emotion, and tears of relief and joy are shed. Hege Bjornebye sums up what many of the aid volunteers are feeling at this time: â€œYou have this moment now of joy and thanks from the people arriving here, and all weâ€™ve done is stretch out a hand of friendship, and they are so grateful for that.â€",
                    "The refugees will now have to walk a further 4 kilometres to the first rallying point, where water, food, and dry clothes are distributed.Â  Hopefully, but not always, buses will take them from there to Oxi, a further rallying point. This bus service is actually quite a new phenomenon and is a result of some of the bigger players in the aid world, such as Action Aid and Doctors without Borders, coming to the island. Previously everyone, men, women and children, the disabled and the injured, would have had to walk as best as they could the 40 kilometres to Moria to be registered and then to Mytilini port for the passage to mainland Greece. At Oxi theyâ€™ll be split into those who are Syrian refugees and â€œeveryone elseâ€. The Syrians will be transferred to Karatepe Registration Camp and â€œeveryone elseâ€ to Moria. This segregation has already caused some tensions amongst the refugees. While Syria and its brutal war is present in the daily news headlines of Europe, other asylum seekers from equally dangerous places on the world map feel that they have been forgotten and are being sidelined in the asylum process. The obvious difference between the two registration camps â€“ Moria being hopelessly overcrowded, lacking personnel and the most basic facilities, with poor hygienic conditions â€“ may underpin this perception. After having made it through the registration procedure, a further journey onto Mytilini Port is required to secure their ferry tickets to mainland Greece from where most peopleâ€™s journeys continue.",
                    "Tragically not all of the boats make it to shore. The International Organisation for Migration, a partner monitoring group of the United Nations, estimates that of the 430,000 men, women and children who have so far crossed the Mediterranean waters to mainland Europe in 2015, 2,748 have drowned or gone missing. Bearing witness to this loss of life is Saint Panteleimos Cemetery, set high on the hillside above the port of Mytilini. Here, the bodies washed ashore on the island are buried. â€œOne of the worst projects is the gravesâ€ explains Efi Latsoudi: â€œWe want to at least bury people with some form of dignity. Because of the financial situation here in Greece the refugees have to dig the graves themselves for those who have drowned. Weâ€™ve persuaded a sympathetic local undertaker to transport the bodies to the cemetery for free, and the refugees hold a ceremony for the deceased that they find appropriate. Most of the graves are marked as â€œunknownâ€, since usually no documents are found with the bodies washed ashore. We try to get the hospital to take DNA samples, so maybe at a later date they can be identified. We really worry that with the winter approaching and the crossing over the sea becoming more perilous, the number of deaths will only increase.â€",
                    "Back at PIKPA thereâ€™s a happier atmosphere in the air. Children are playing freely on swings and merry-go-rounds in the campgrounds, while the adults take on the care and duty of keeping PIKPA spotless before cooking the evening meal. 3-year-old Norsarine Masavee rummaging amongst the donated childrenâ€™s toys has discovered a music box. As she opens it, of all melodies the tones of Beethovenâ€™s â€œOde to Joyâ€ can be heard. As the sound of this optimistic hymn that is now the official Anthem of The European Union drifts across the camp, Joel Johannson quietly articulates some sentiments which are probably universal to those involved as witnesses to this biblical exodus of refugees taking place on Europeâ€™s borders: â€œWe are all actually just in this altogether.â€",

However, as with all attempts to dictate how rational, competent adults should conduct themselves according to some arbitrary, overhanging rules, I recognise this requires on-going discussion and constant defence.",
                    "Condemning nonviolent, unthreatening men and women for merely favouring a particular gender is such an absurdity it can only arise from absolute certainty about our species and ourselves. Consider the recent case of radio â€œpersonalityâ€ DJ Dominic Dieter who told a listener, concerned his daughter might be gay, that the listener â€œshould get one of your friends to screw your daughter straight.â€ I donâ€™t think Dieter should be arrested for such a remark (despite it being an idiotic attempt at humour recommending corrective rape), but I am interested that one could, so easily, make such a flippant comment. I am also surprised that some of the write-ups on Dieterâ€™s comment havenâ€™t mentioned another important fact: What good reason does the father have to be â€œconcernedâ€ that his daughter is gay? (Also, why ask such a homophobe about advice on gays? Itâ€™s like asking a man with a hammer what to do about this jutting out nail.)",
                    "All this ties in to the idea that being gay is somehow â€œwrongâ€. Often, the way itâ€™s portrayed by homophobes, or those who dislike gays intensely, is that members of the LGBT community have something slightly â€œoffâ€ about themselves which requires our attention. Whether this is denying them marriage or blood donations, praying (or raping) the gay away, itâ€™s treated like a deformity that canâ€™t be fixed medically (which should hint that it isnâ€™t a deformity at all).",
                    "That is why you often see the claim that homosexuality is â€œnot naturalâ€. By now, we should all recognise equating something being â€œnot naturalâ€ with it being bad as a fallacious move.",
                    "Firstly, if we mean â€œdoes not occur in the animal kingdomâ€, then that is patently false. For example, Bruce Bagemihlâ€™s 1999 book, Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity, documents homosexuality in 1,500 species â€“ from apes to worms. But this tells us nothing morally relevant! Animals also eat their young â€“ shall we do so, too? Obviously we do not align ourselves to the whims of nature, so even if we care to show that homosexual behaviour is frequently documented in nature, it doesnâ€™t tell us that homosexuality is wrong. It just tells us it occurs in other species. Secondly, if we mean it is not what our bodies were made for, then that too is uninteresting: How do we know what our bodies were made for? As commenters have said to me, we can say that, for example, our noses were â€œdesignedâ€ to be adequate olfactory sensors. But that doesnâ€™t mean we canâ€™t use them to support devices (spectacles) to aid our malfunctioning eyes (some design, by the way). We do various things with our bodies all the time that they werenâ€™t designed for, but we give the middle finger to â€œMotherâ€ nature and head off into space, to the bottom of the ocean, and into lava pits anyway.",
                    "After our minds, our bodies are the last place that no one else should be able to control, the domain over which we should reign.

                    "Worse still is the assumption that relationships are geared only toward procreation â€“ and since gays and lesbians canâ€™t procreate, it is somehow wrong. If even single people can procreate, how can we say gay couples canâ€™t? Technology now allows for surrogacy and â€œtest-tubeâ€ babies, for all manner of people. Of course, what critics mean is that gays and lesbians canâ€™t reproduce â€œnaturallyâ€ â€“ this use of the term means â€œwithout the aid of modern technologyâ€. But then this means that all infertile couples, old and young, should not be able to be together, either. Furthermore, to view relationships as only instrumental toward continuing the human species is â€“ aside from being generally creepy â€“ shallow and myopic. What about couples â€“ gay and straight â€“ who are not interested in procreating (whether out of a moral choice or because both already have)? The absurdity should be apparent.",

It finds obvious expression with religions, but I notice it even in discussions of procreation with secular people. It is a worrying theme, as seen here with LGBT rights, since people donâ€™t engage with actual arguments or reasoning but appeal to some process â€“ godâ€™s design, the natural world, tradition â€“ that lock their views in place, caging potential beneficence. This is not merely abstract engagement but, as with gay rights, has actual harmful consequences because people are too afraid to examine, criticise and possibly reconsider their own views.
