                "The term \u201cqueer ecology\u201d refers to a loose, interdisciplinary constellation of practices that aim, in different ways, to disrupt prevailing heterosexist discursive and institutional articulations of sexuality and nature, and also to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics in light of queer theory. Drawing from traditions as diverse as evolutionary biology, LGBTTIQQ2SA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, questioning, two-spirited, and allies) movements, and queer geography and history, feminist science studies, ecofeminism, and environmental justice, queer ecology currently highlights the complexity of contemporary biopolitics, draws important connections between the material and cultural dimensions of environmental issues, and insists on an articulatory practice in which sex and nature are understood in light of multiple trajectories of power and matter.",
                "In The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault lays the groundwork for much contemporary queer ecological scholarship in his observation that, beginning in the nineteenth century, modern regimes of biopower came to conceive of sex as a specific object of scientific knowledge, organized through, on the one hand, a \u201cbiology of reproduction\u201d that considered human sexual behavior in relation to the physiologies of plant and animal reproduction, and on the other, a \u201cmedicine of sex\u201d that conceived of human sexuality in terms of desire and identity (1978, 54). Although Foucault rightly notes the tenuous early connections between the two discourses, the establishment of sex as a matter of biopolitical truth could not help but be connected to ideas of nature, and especially to racialized, sexualized, and other anxieties over hygiene and degeneracy. In this context, the figure of the homosexual came to haunt the margins of emerging discourses in urban development, environmental health, and even wilderness preservation: the effeminate homosexual and the lesbian gender invert were not only seen increasingly as against nature but also sometimes considered symptoms of the toxic underside of industrial, urban, and increasingly cosmopolitan modernity.",
                "In this context, a prehistory of queer ecology must include the attempts of such authors as Andr\u00e9 Gide and Radclyffe Hall to turn these discourses on their heads (famously, of course, Oscar Wilde embraced his position \u201cagainst\u201d nature). Specifically, the placement of sexual desire and orientation in the purview of evolutionary concern gave rise not only to the articulation of homosexuality with degeneracy but also to the possibility that a variety of sexual practices and identities could be understood as \u201cnatural\u201d and, therefore, morally neutral; indeed, early sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote, in 1905, that \u201cone might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population\u201d (9). Drawing on the rich historical inclusion of same-sex (male) eroticism in pastoral literatures, Gide\u2019s Corydon (published in four parts from 1911 to 1920) thus pursued the idea that the homosexual activities of boy-shepherds represented a more authentic and innocent sexuality than the heterosexual conventions they needed to learn in order to enter into adult relations of (enforced) heterosexuality (Shuttleton 2000). Similarly, Hall\u2019s Well of Loneliness (1928) painted a tragic portrait of a lesbian gender invert who was, if anything, by nature nobler and more moral than any of the other characters in the book (a portrayal that caused the book to be banned in Britain, see Mortimer-Sandilands 2008b). Although both texts were thoroughly steeped in the class, racialized, and gender politics of the era and are problematic for a host of reasons associated with neopastoral literatures more broadly (Corydon is deeply misogynist; The Well is profoundly nationalist; both deploy nature as an agent of conservatism), they and others played an important role in setting the conceptual stage for more recent attempts to queer nature and ecology. Indeed, despite their considerable political differences, one can place in productive conversation with Gide and Hall such phenomena as the post-Stonewall emergence of gay and lesbian-feminist anti-urbanisms (Herring 2007; Kleiner 2003; Sandilands 2002) and the more recent articulation of (some) discourses on urban cruising and public sex with organicist renderings of eroticism, freedom, and opposition to heteronormative productions of/restrictions on urban public space (Gandy 2012; Ingram 2010).",
                "From these roots, beginning in the mid-1990s (e.g., Undercurrents 1994; Gaard 1997), a distinct body of queer ecological scholarship has emerged that has attempted to develop theoretical and activist connections between sexual and ecological politics, often drawing from ecofeminist and environmental justice perspectives and including concerted attention to the racialized, gendered, colonial, and species politics with which notions of sex and nature are articulated (especially as influenced by the writings of Donna Haraway, e.g., 1991b). As Rachel Stein writes, \u201cby analyzing how discourses of nature have been used to enforce heteronormativity, to police sexuality, and to punish and exclude those persons who have been deemed sexually transgressive, we can begin to understand the deep, underlying commonalities between struggles against sexual oppression and other struggles for environmental justice\u201d (2004, 7). This emphasis on the intersectional politics of sexuality, race, and ecology informs the work of Dayna Scott (2009) and Giovanna Di Chiro (2010), both of whom develop critical responses to the \u201cgender-bending\u201d impacts of endocrine-disrupting hormones in the environment (which particularly affect racialized and indigenous communities) while simultaneously disrupting heterosexist panics about the so-called feminization of organisms and populations of organisms, human and otherwise. Beth Berila (2004), Stacy Alaimo (2010a), and Mel Chen (2012) likewise examine the politics of contamination as toxic affects move in, through, and as gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies: as Chen writes powerfully, toxic substances and discourses organize worlds in which some biopolitical subjects are enabled and their life optimized by medical and environmental interventions at the same time as other subjects are themselves considered toxic, expellable, and expendable. And Eli Clare (1999) treats the intersections of class and disability in his account of (among other things) the varied exclusions of an urban environmental politics and aesthetics that pays scant critical attention to the ways in which people work and move in natural environments, and also to bodies and landscapes that are abjected in the production and management of the pristine.",
                "Sharing similar roots but on a slightly different trajectory, beginning in the late 1990s (although drawing on a longer line of inquiry, see Terry 2000), research in animal behavior by the likes of Bruce Bagemihl (1999) and Joan Roughgarden (2004) has drawn popular attention to the fact that a large array of animal species include elements of same-sex eroticism in their sexual repertoires; in so doing, this research has attempted to dislodge heterosexual reproduction from its singularly privileged place in evolutionary biology, to connect notions of sexual diversity with biological diversity (for a critique, see McWhorter 2010), and to open the door for a nonteleological reconsideration of animal/human sociality and pleasure (Alaimo 2010b; Johnson 2011). As homonormative popular culture has embraced so-called queer animals in the midst of a larger naturalization of same-sex marriage (especially \u201cgay\u201d male penguins, see Sturgeon 2010), and as images of polymorphously perverse animal and invertebrate sex have come to populate the ideosphere in the service of sexual pluralism (Green Porno 2009), several scholars suggest ways in which this queering of the more-than-human could proceed in more critical directions. Elizabeth Wilson (2002) and Myra Hird (2004, 2008) consider the ways in which nonhuman sexual and gender diversity both calls into question human exceptionalism and destabilizes notions of identity, authenticity, and technology on which modern categories of human sexual orientation rest; Karen Barad (2012), deploying a notion of queer performativity to strong posthumanist ends, explores the ways in which the material world can be understood as unfolding according to a process of relational co-constitution in which materialization itself can be understood queerly (see also Morton 2010); and several authors call upon the queer potentialities of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s thought in order to nudge queer and trans theory to think more ecologically, in other words, to consider sexual and gender becomings as complex biological, technological, and political assemblages rather than as either purely discursive or biologically determined processes (Parisi 2008; MacCormack 2009; Chisholm 2010; Hayward 2008\u00a0and, for a critique,\u00a0Garrard 2010).",
                "Recent scholarship has drawn from combinations of these theoretical trajectories (and beyond) to generate a proliferating array of queer ecological possibilities, including provocative considerations of cross-species and eco-sexualities as part of an ethico-political opening of love to include more-than-human corporealities (e.g.,\u00a0Kuzniar 2008; Sandilands 2004; Stephens and Sprinkle 2012); of the implications of queer theorist Lee Edelman\u2019s critique of reproductive futurism for ecological politics (Giffney 2008; Anderson 2011; Seymour 2013); and of canonical literary texts, reread and restaged in light of queer ecological concerns (Estok 2011; Azzarello 2012). In addition, new forms of specifically ecoqueer activism, demonstrating interesting forms of coalitional politics in opposition to homonormative agendas, are also emerging in response to such concerns as violence, space, and food (Hogan 2010; Sbicca 2012). In both theoretical and activist milieux, however, questions remain about the specific meaning of the term \u201cqueer,\u201d given its historically and politically unstable relations to LGBTTIQQ2SA communities and activisms; the current constellation of queer ecologies\u2014including as it does both more conventional lgbt histories and communities and more recent challenges to these terms and political affinities\u2014may be on the verge of something new."

So other than being a force for helping people to avoid it and to be delivered from it, they have instead become a force for trying to introduce it to young people the same way they were introduced and it\u2019s really tragic. Look, they claim that we hate them and there is nothing we can do to persuade them otherwise because if you don\u2019t go along with what they want to do they\u2019re going to label you as a hater.

I\u2019ve heard them complain about it, they say \u2018so many of these guys are homosexuals\u2019 and they are frankly frustrated by it because they\u2019re saying these are often nice looking men, they look like they can build a life for themselves but they\u2019re not interested in a marriage to a woman, they\u2019re interested in being with another man. There\u2019s something that is going on in the community and I think fatherlessness has contributed to it greatly because if you haven\u2019t been loved by your father, just like young ladies do, young men can do the same thing. They can make the mistake, particularly if they are recruited into it, they find a man who will love them and give them what they\u2019re looking for but sexualize them then they end up for the rest of their lives end up looking for love in all the wrong places.

                "Remember that time, roughly two months ago, when President Trump promised not to roll back an order protecting the rights of LGBTQ workers? Yeah, well, he lied. Surprise!",
                "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order revoking key parts of previous orders by President Obama, which had effectively banned federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Under Executive Order 13673, which Obama issued in 2014, companies receiving federal contracts in excess of half a million dollars were required to demonstrate they had complied with a set of 15 federal or state labor laws over the previous three years; several of those laws offered critical protections for LGBTQ workers.",
                "The measure, also known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order, was issued in conjunction with Executive Order 13672, the latter of which explicitly prohibited federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexuality. Although Trump did not erase that order, his mandate to eliminate order 13673 cripples its effectiveness. By removing the requirement that companies prove their compliance with federal law, the government has no way to ensure they\u2019re also following the nondiscrimination requirements Obama explicitly laid out. In other words, the president has created a major loophole that could allow companies to deny LGBTQ people opportunities or otherwise treat them unequally\u2014and those organizations can still receive massive federal contracts.",
                "\u201cThis administration has made it extremely difficult to enforce these federal laws as applied to federal contractors,\u201d Camilla Taylor, senior counsel at the LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal, told Keen News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s sending a message to these companies . . . that the federal government simply doesn\u2019t care whether or not they violate the law.\u201d",
                "Due to a lack of explicit protections for sexual orientation and gender identity in most states and on the federal level, Obama\u2019s presidential orders were the only legal measures protecting more than 1 million LGBTQ workers. As Think Progress reports, the orders merely amended previous executive actions that protected federal contractor employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, nationality, disability, and age\u2014all identity categories that are still guaranteed protection under other federal laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, and Age Discrimination in Employment Act. No such act directly affords workers protection on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity; that\u2019s what necessitated order 13672 in the first place.",
                "Erasure seems to be something Trump has a knack for when it comes to the LGBTQ community: This week, the Census Bureau announced it would not include data on sexual orientation or gender identity in its 2020 survey, a decision the White House can directly influence. By refusing to count LGBTQ people in the United States, the Trump administration is also refusing to take the necessary steps to represent them and their interests. Then again, by refusing to keep in place rules that afford LGBTQ people protection from discrimination, Trump isn\u2019t just refusing to acknowledge that discrimination exists; he\u2019s suggesting it might even be business as usual."

Psychology has traditionally regarded as inevitable -- and, in fact, necessary -- a female child's eventual separation from her mother as adulthood ensues. Now renowned psychologist and author Martha Manning offers mothers and daughters of all ages a revolutionary new way of understanding each other and their relationships, and challenges the accepted thinking that this powerful bond must ultimately be severed. In a work of intelligence, wit, heart, and scholarship, Manning examines this important link and concludes that it is a precious attachment that is never outgrown -- that, while the differing, ever-changing needs, conflicts, and obligations of two distinct women may create a chasm between them, bridging the gap will serve to strengthen a lifelong commitment, love, and identity, while fostering essential independence. The key is empathy.",
                "Through empathy -- the ability to perceive the other's actions as an aspect of individual behavior -- even a troubled relationship can become gratifying and beautiful. Exploring the developmental stages of the mother-daughter union from infancy through old age, Manning provides potent tools to help us build stronger ties, enabling us to celebrate rather than eschew the twists and turns, joys, secrets, and surprises inherent in this most glorious of life connections. She also focuses new attention on the parts played by cultural, historical, psychological, and biological influences, areas often ignored in previous works on the subject.",

For everyone who is, and always will be, a mother, a daughter, or both, this important, inspiring book will guide the reader toward a new love and respect born of understanding and the enriching ability to find the common thread."

                " While chapter titles (\"Pregnancy and Childbirth,\" \"Infancy,\" \"Childhood,\" and so on) suggest a clear progression, Manning's tendency is to travel whatever fascinating allegorical \"back roads\" she spots. Thus, her young adulthood chapter wonderfully dissects the elements of change, autonomy, and the new roles mothers assume as their daughters enter this stage; yet along the route, readers will find gems in Manning's references to Venn diagrams, passports, many contemporary books and plays, and a sitcom-worthy transcript from a visit to her elderly parents, titled, \"You Can Never Have Too Much Heat and Light.\" ",
